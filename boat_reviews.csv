I bought this in sept and I'm NOT SATISFIED with the purchase... Don't get me wrong, the sound quality is amazing for a earphone this cheap, but its flat... The bass kicks in only when there's too much bass in the music, else the sound feels very flat... Also the audio via the microphone is bad, and the mic is located on the split end of the cable, which is very low... At times I've heard people complaining that they cannot hear my voice clearly... Only for those who are struck with the price tag of 300-400rs... In that range its good, but if you can spend a 100rs more, get the basshead 225...

For a price of rs 400 it's worth the cost, i previously used boat bassheads 225, now i tried this for pricing it does the job.Pros,Easy fitNice qualityGood bassInbuilt micCons.It doesn't have a clip or dual coloured ear buds noraml black only.Maybe you should give blue, red colour like other products.The connecting cable will be flat unlike folded one, that quite difficult while playing games or youtube bt you figure it out gow to mangae itUpdateAfter 9 months one side stopped working and i have complained in their official website with downloaded invoice from amazon and the next day my product was picked and in next 15 days got newer one. For the 400 rs it lasted about one and half years that was good for the price and it has one year warranty compared to mi and realme 6 months warranty and you have to carry your products to their outlets.Note .While claiming warranty you have to upload invoice that has to be downloaded only in pc version as of now ,so login amzon account in seperate browser in desktop mode or use pc to download the invoice.

After using it for less than one week one of the headphone wire comes from the Mic join point. It detached automatically. Yes, automatically. No pressure no pulling caused this. I did my registration and complain to their website. They sent me a ticket number through email and text message. I am so so disappointed ; don't know when pick up will happen and when I will get a non defective earphone. Such a horrible experience.

This is a very great earphone with a good quality sound, but it's not for rough usage! The sound is flat, so less bass in regular condition! But the earphone has got a very good frequency range. So still a deep bass is possible but with an equalizer. You can try my preset.  Also remember that the quality of sound also depends on your device's sound card.

I bought this earphone cause I had read in the reviews that they provide excellent after sales service and replace the earphone if any defect occurs. I had previously tried many companies earphones but in a few months always they would give problems. The sound quality and durability is amazing for the price. But due to rough usage one ear stopped working after 3 months. But the after sales services are amazing. They arranged a pickup of my old earphones and delivered a new pair to me after 10 days.Really happy customer

One of my friend has this product that's y I came for this product.  My idea is to by skull candy only but cos of my frd i came for this product. He s having good product but what I got is defective material. Actually i got this by last week at my work place. I got an emergency to travel so i left the product at my office itself. Yesterday I came and checked the product. It's a broken one. Yes it's broke at the connector area.  They hide it and deliver to me. While checking the product didn't work after full checking headset came into 2 parts. Kindly return my money back or send me a genuine product.

Edit : After two week of usage I realized that sound leaks from the earphone. So other people may get irritated.  Bought these earphones in a sale for 400₹. I have already used boat bassheads 225 and this time also boat doesn’t disappoint me. Here are my impressions: Clear output Quality build Low weight plastic build (I was disappointed with bassheads 225 since they have bulky metal build ) Great customer service Medium bass Decent microphone ( I didn’t face any problem during a call) Great designFor 500₹ I think it is overpriced. During Amazon sale and sometimes daily deals price drops to 400. You should definitely buy at this price. But MI basic earphones also comes at this price. If you are looking for clear sound quality you should go for mi basic otherwise for bass you should go for boat.

its been two or 3 weeks since i brought this item, it was working well for 3 weeks after i brought this item and then all of a sudden one of the drivers stopped working and i was like damn these earphones were made by a leading company how come they could have made such a unworthy product. and the main part is that the bass is not that good actually saying bad. so, i suggest everyone not to buy this product.  SPREAD THIS !

I haven't heard about this brand until my colleague told me about it when I was looking for earphones on Amazon. I ordered this pair after reading 80% good reviews on Amazon. It arrived within 48 hours thanks to Amazon Prime. The pair looks beautiful. The sound quality is surprisingly good for a below 500 rupees earphones. The only problem with the earphones is the fit, it doesn't stick to your ears when you are walking or running. I have to keep adjusting it every 5 minutes. Other than that, it is more value for money.

I have lotsn lood Earphones. I have bass heads 225 as well. To be honest this one is for a more casual use in bikes and travel etc and there's the problem.the wires are actually not looking that strong and the lack of L pattern jack actually makes it a problem for keeping pockets jeans and riding a bike.Sound burn in is extremely important and no one reviews that way because everyone will just buy and plugin and give the reviews the drivers need to be calibrated for any speaker earphone headphone anything for a minimum of 20hrs. I have kept it on olaymode for more than 8 hrs now and this is really good. Bass is real good and serves the purpose very very well.Major points1.its not as sturdy as bass heads 225 is atleast in the feel.2.the look n feel is not premium again compared to 2253.why they didnt give an L pattern jack they only know and it sucks4.price point is great just below 400.5.most importantly the brand presence and service is great.Buy it if u r a basshead and also the vocals are great. I always listen to Arijit Singh Laal ishq from Ramleela for testing any earphone and headphone its superb... Butbuf u have a little more budget go for 225One small note for the bikers... This will be a great in helmet choice as bass heads 225 will be a little pain on the ears within helmet as it has a little longer metal ear cap vent.

Looking for earphones online? This may be the best choice for you.if you are a stock Android user or any user, this earphone provides the best hearing experience.I'm using this earphone since hours, but no pain in ears or head,  that means their ergonomic design really worked.The Black colour looks more classy then other colours , and its design is beautiful .if we talk about comfort.., do they well played here.,these are so comfortable .but we can purchase same audio quality earphone through the market , like ubon big daddy bass for less than 300 rs but the durabilty ,and comfort is not same as these earphones .Cable - cable is good ,it is tangle free and easy to handle.Design - impressive design , it doesn't fall from your ears even while running .Button - it provides a single button , but can fo many things with this single button if you are a android user .1. double tap to play next song .2. triple tap to play previous song .3. long press to access google assistant and directly apply operations4. single tap for play and resumeThe button is comparatively very smooth to press.

Says on the pack extra bass. But no bass sound. So I installed a Equalizer in my phone and increased bass. Right earphone started giving additional ish ish sound at the end of each bass beat. The kind of sound you would hear if you increase the volume too high and the speaker diaphragm makes a sound out of extra vibration. I have used senheiser before. My toddler son  has habit of breaking things, so settled for this one. If you planned spend more. Just go for other ones. Not this product.

Boat brand was unknown to me. I gave it a shot and bought these earphones after reading several positive reviews. For this price there are no other better earphones out there. First thing I noticed was how strong the connecting cables were, much tougher and sturdier as compared to other well known brands. The earpieces also fit tightly into the ears and seem on the harder side. They will never fall off from the ears. Sound quality is above average as compared to their next product in the hierarchy. Frankly the only missing part is the heavy bass.(this comparison is unfair as I also use Sony XB 550) Other than that an excellent product.

Having used SoundMagic ES18s, JBL C200SI and Sennheiser CX 180 Street II which are known top selling. This product is breaks the budget market segment. Here is my verdict:Pros: 1. Great for Bass lovers. 2. Overall clarity of output is quite good. 3. Eye catchy design. 4. Mic performance is good on calls. 5. Decent wire length.Cons: 1. The wire is of high quality but feels too rubbery.One of the best in ear earphones if you are looking for daily use and do not want to spend much on an earphone.Overall the sound quality is too good for its price. I would recommend this product especially for phone usage.

Okay product. Will comment in 3-6 months regarding durability.These are supposed to be basshead earphones but I don't think they qualify - not at their price range.They don't really boost bass just amplify it and make the entire lower range frequency louder. As a result, if you go above the halfway volume mark, the sound sort of starts cracking and hurting ears. The problem goes away a bit when you tweak the sound settings. However, the range is small. If you optimize settings for bass, then treble starts cracking, and if you optimise for middle range sounds (can't really get a good treble), then bass starts cracking. Just not satisfactory for me.Of course, everyone's taste in music is different and their requirements from earphones are different. Obviously, I listen to everything from Opera and Death metal to bluegrass and hip-hop to rap and jazz to Punjabi upbeat songs and Ghazals. So this earphone covers only a fraction of all that and hence I do not particularly like them even for the price of rs 379 that I paid in the lightning deal. There were a few cheaper earphones that were much better than these and I only bought this because they were out of stock.However, if your taste in music covers a narrow frequency range and similar genres and you just want loud percussion sounds and don't care about much else, go for it.As for watching TV shows and Movies, earphones generally don't affect the experience that much unless they are too good or too bad. However, here too, I find that the sound gets annoying if the volume is too high and I cannot eat while watching because it amplifies the sound of my jaw too much. Plus it makes everything sound a little weird. But I guess the last part gets adjusted with use.All in all, I will try a different pair next time. I mainly checked the reviews and bought them because they were rated high on durability. If they break soon, then there will be no point in me ever buying them again. I will see how long they last.

Felt like Cheap Chinese Headphones in some nice packing.Go for Sennheiser, I wasn't able to wear then single day.Pro - So Loud at full they can even bleed your ears too.Cons- High bass driven outshines the highs and the mids ( Vocals lie deep down that boom boom)- Not that comfortable to wear.- even design is So called hawk but it is not if comfort is considered.Choice is Yours.

honestly saying, i was influenced to buy this product from my friend who is already using this product. i opted this over sony as this product is giving better sounds than that. i purchased this product and after few days of using, the left earphone started to give odd sounds. it actually giving symptoms of not going to work in future, exactly what happened within  days. it completely stopped working.i thought a product defect and applied for warranty (used for one month). then i came to know that the same problem my friend is also facing with the same earphones. his earphones also got the same wire issue.so i better suggest you to not buy this product.thank you.

What I dislike about this earphone is its design. It is not at all ergonomic.There are some significant flaws. I write this, after having used Mi red phones which are in the same price range -300-400/-1. The ear buds are too small and don't give you that tight grip feel. It will fall off in the slightest of activity2. Position of mic: The mic is situated very low, at the point of intersection between 2 strings. It literally falls till you lower chest. So while talking on phone you have to hold the mic up manually near your mouth. In Mi earphones mic is placed near the right ear string, at a height near your face. That makes it easy to talk while earphones are on.3. The connecting cable at the point where you plugin to your phone is too long. That makes it prone to a lot of bending.This may cause early breakage.Having owned both earphones, I would recommend Mi over Boat.Voice quality is similar. Just above decent

Very bad product! I bought in may,2019 and only after 3 months one side of the earphone is not working! And the invoice that i have received from amazon, the boat customer care is telling it to be invalid when i am trying to opt for the warranty. Very bad experience! After this i called amazon and then had to download the invoive from the desktop site of amazon.in and not the amazon app..after that i could lodge a complain and then i got a replacement after 1 and a half month..

Just two hours into listening music on this headset, and it is really at par with many of the reputed brands..I have been a fan of JBL head sets but, this one is also is at par with it but at a lesser price.. started to like boAt as a brand and lifestyle products manufacturer. Even the shape of the ear buds is different than regular rounded shapes...Good to see some different shaped head set.Got this one during the sale on Amazon, and I feel it's value for money.

Actually there is nothing in the product that can be appreciated..The product is promoted on the basis of quality of extra bass which is totally a fake promotion.

I dont know how people are rating this as 3+ above. For low quality headphone people who used this first time would be good. I'm using Sony headsets past 7-8Yrs n after seeing this rating 4+ I opted to buy, but after listening music of all tracks I regretted this purchase but my luck my other friend liked this red color and added 2 his collection.Add 400 more bucks and try Sony basic headset and you will realise the beats...If higher value then beats are hard..

I had been using this earphones from last 1  week. It' been fine. The deleivery for this product was on time. The product was not fully protected though there was only box and amazon carry bag. I would like to tell you guys its pros and consPros:-Sound quality is great.Bass is well1) Treble is ok, somehow it is diminished by 2) High tones3) Buid quality is ok.4) Design is good.Thats all pros now lets move to cons:-…Less than 2 months of usage one side already stopped working.Sound is OK, but what good a product that has no life. Couldn't find a way to replace as well.No extra strains applied, always kept coiled with velcro strap.

I bought this a month ago, I was kinda happy in the beginning and then not even a month had gone one of it's side stopped working. I was pissed off. I tried calling Boat customer service number which I got from their official website but it was a wrong number then I placed a complaint on it's website on 28th of June 2019 they did a pick up on 30th June and I got a parcel on 17th of July 2019. When I opened it I was so disheartened by seeing an Earphone with only one pair of buds which were black. I returned them the whole box with earphones and this is what I got. I would never ever buy anything from BOAT and would never recommend anybody to buy anything from them as they do not value their customers nor their time their patience. Pathetic Experience, thought of sharing so you wouldn't be the next victim.

It is a decent product from boat, decent bass treble is good.If you want to buy a earphone that explodes with bass don't go for this one, but if you want clear punch and drum sound... then you should definitely buy this as its bass doesn't blend with treble and ruin the quality...Overall the nice product if you'll consider the price also.... I bought this at 399. Also oneore thing I like about the boat is that it gives the warranty of a year so if product stop working you can simply go to product complaint site and upload the bill within a week they schedule a pickup and exchange your earphone unlike other earphone products where you have to courier them by your own.

Important: I love these earphones, very good quality and good mic, but every 2-3 months, one side of the earphones stop working.. so you have to replace it. Just ordering my 3rd set after 4 months.. but it’s worth the price, I mean if u buy 2000 rupees one it would still stop working after maybe 5-6 months... unless you buy a product which is like 5k, u would still have to keep replacing... but it’s worth the price.. thank you for reading, hope it helps..

Material qualityThe earphones come with extra in ear plugs for choosing the right size for your ear. Those extra plush do not fit the earphone. Only the one that the earphone comes attached to, works. The rest of them are useless, there by throwing the size selection out the window.SoundPersonal opinion, the sound felt a little hollow, as if I was in a room hearing background echo. The sounds are very much different from all other earphones and over head headphones I have used.Also tapping the wire give you a tap sound in the ear. So if you are moving and the wire brushes against your clothing or hand, you get a disturbance in your ear. This is something I have never experienced earlier.The microphone and pause/play button works well.DurabilityOverall looks a bit fragile. Will wait on this to see if it lasts.In conclusionThe earphones do the job, a little compromise on quality.

Sound - 3/5Mic- 4/5Design- 3/5Durability- 3/5Mic is better,above than average. Looks wise good, black sleek design. Mic is places bit low but it would work fine. Sound is okay,not that great. Ordered it for my little brother and till now he is enjoying it.If you listen music alot and want an earphones for talking as well, this is good oneSuggestion: we all use handsfree and mainly listen music while keeping cell in pocket, its better if manufacturers make L shape jacks so that while taking out the phone while driving or from tight pants, cables dont get tear easily from 3.5 jack and makes the whole handsfree useless.Edit: durability is poor, after couple of months wire started reading, sound distortion and now one eat plug stopped working.

I bought these since my earlier one had conked off. The earbuds have good quality of sound but the button does not work as advertised. No matter how many times I tried it refused to work & I have to swipe on the phone to answer a call which defeats the purpose of buying it. The mic is also not positioned in a way that my Cowon was which leads to problems in using it when you need only one of them in your ear.

So I have purchased this one for myself. I'm already using mi basic earphone while I wished to test it's sound cause this earphone is so popular. So after delivery when I compared it's sound with my mi basic earphone i found that this earphone is louder and has clear voice where bass goes less under the voices...mid and high are so clear but lower no satisfactory while mi basic has more bass with same level of mid high and low ... This boat earphone's impedance is 16ohm lower means it consumes less power while mi basic has 32ohm impedance.That's good while it has same driver unit size 10mm and frequency range and sensivity like mi one. It has 1.2m wire which is tangle free and strong. But it has no L shape 3.5mm connector which is helpful specially when keeping smartphone in pocket. Also no gold plate on the jack. While mi basic has that. But appearance design and packaging has creativity touch. Driver cabinet made of plastic with unique design but no metal there. it has control unit with mic hole and press button which is helpful to play or pause music or to answer the call. Mic's sound input is good but not the best . Also it has wire managment tape marked with boat when you don't need the whole wire to use. Comes with as usual small medium large earbuds. The earbuds seals your ear very well to prevent any ambient noise. It has 1 year of boat warranty while mi has 6 months.  Also there are a product catelouge which shows different product variety of Boat. So I liked it the special design and sound clarity , not the bass which it's name says. If it is for more bass with normal sound then I will prefer mi basic one. LIKE my review if found helpful. Can checkout attached photos.

BASS QUALITY= Nicebeats detail  = great(at full volume minor buzzing sound, that can be avoidable)at this price range you are getting a microphone enabled superbass earphone.plastic material is fine and it will not feel like any cheap one. design is also good. and will be fit in your year.you will receive 2  pair buds along with it and 1year warranty note inside the box.look like if i go for upper versions of boat's product , it is going to beat my skullcandy one.

I had these delivered to me within 2 hours of placing the order on a Sunday afternoon. That is QUITE something! And at 379₹ you couldn't ask for a nicer pair of basic earphones with mic. They come with a 1 year warranty which is good.The mic isn't noise cancelling but it's decently clear during calls. I can comfortably take calls as long as the room is silent.The impedence is low, and thus they feel louder when connected to a phone. I drive mine through Xiaomi's Bluetooth Receiver. They're easily better than the Xiaomi Sports Basic Bluetooth earphones they replaced. I need to significantly reduce the volume on my phone because of how loud they are.While they're good to listen to music on, I dislike the fact that the frequency response isn't flat. The bass and some upper mids feel very pushed. I'll probably to struggle get my music mixes right on these.Overall I rated them 5/5 because at the price I paid they're a good package.

I don’t know much about headphones so I randomly found these which said they’ll have Bass for Bass lovers like me, so I went for them.Turns out, they are nothing what I expected from boAt.Packaging was fine, got an extra pair of silicone heads with a 1 wear warranty card.But,The moment I put them on, and played a heavy bass song, they literally went to split my ear in two with the insane amount of treble and sharp noise it produced.I even went to adjust the Equalizer according to them but It didn’t do any good.I have an iPhone and thought of buying Airpods but before that I was on a spree to get my hands on some other headphones for spare.It was a lightening deal which I really don’t mind but the amount of dissatisfaction they provided made me rethink about the decision of buying boAt’ wireless headphones.

When it first arrived, I was quite pleased with the packaging and the stuff that was provided with is. 2 pairs of extra ear buds, the wire strap and the tiny bag!The earphone sound quality is pretty good for such a price. I have a seinheisers as well, and the quality of boat is almost at par, with this being only 375 and that at 700+ Rs.Noise cancellation is pretty good too! I use it to study when there is too much noise around the house and it works perfectly fine and blocks all the noise outAnd finally bass quality, it isn't the best out there but for a price like this, it's pretty acceptable, given all the accessories they give tooIt has an inbuilt mic and both the voices are very clears during calls.Quite happy with the product, been using it for a month now!

Looks fine...Product quality ok...Sound quality- Personally I am not satisfied cost @999/- have bought it unde the prime day deal@399/- .Earlier I was used Sennheiser CX 180 Street without mic and the sound / Bass clearly is accurate fully satisfied product and currently using bose years Phone old model without noice cancellation but nobody can beet the bose.Under the range @399/ you have other options too so check it however boat product is not more then 299/- maximum.

For price less thn 500 go for it dont see 1,2,5star reviews check only 3&4 star reviews for any of the product u buy online bcz that are true reviews by users.Now abt boat 100 earphnOverall good for listening music ;in movies sound ;comfortable for long hours ; no pain in ear ; during sleep there is no pain while listening sleeping music when ear touched pillow u cant feel any pain; in overall expectations whatever u really want is 4 star.Now what is bad let me tell that plus minus volume button u really miss during journey or in other case. While on using microphn u hve to pick it little up near ur mouth bcz its mic too much lower from ur neck.Generally in all earphones upto 10k we se that at very higher & lower volume (say abv 12/15 or below 3/15) we have issue of treble & bass so let me tell this prblm is general in all earphones below 10k so for common people this is not so much big issueThe issue is at higher vol the earphn bass u r expecting is come with ""khar khar ""sound u feel like ur earphn vibrates too much unnecessary sound.  And in very lower volume u do not feel any bass. In treble mode only (high freq 5,10,15,20kHz only are set at 10dB in equalizer) u feel pain & irritation in ur side head nerves.So if we r talking abt vol abv 3/15 to below 12/15 this earphn are marvellous at cost 349.Also don't buy white piece bcz they become dirty & looks very bad ugly & old  so go for black colour.don't think abt cable got damaged after some time bcz of its round design & not flat ; i think for 1 year there will be no damage unless if u not broke it forcefully.And in last buy only when it is in offer at 349So that ""paisa vasool""👍

I really enjoyed this earphone. This is a very flimsy one, so if you are a person who would keep this one little organized in the bag and not to actually dump the earphone and then pull it out, this can last you long. It comes with additional earbuds which can be useful.Sound quality is good for what you are paying and I really enjoyed listening to music and watch shows with this. The microphones are very good if you are not in a very noisy environment because the noise cancellation in this is bad. Even the sound from far away can be heard by the person on the other end.Sadly this one won't last longer than a year. I had ordered two units and both of them had issues after 13-14 months. With one unit it was one earpiece stopped working and with the second unit, it had some internal damage in the wire due to which there was loose connection leading to loss of sound on the one earpiece.

Being a sound Engineer, I would say, Sparkling Highs, Balanced mid, Good Bass, excellent stereo seperation.I normally use Sennheiser headphones. After hearing the sound quality from my friend who bought this, I was convinced with the quality of these headphones. It's comparable with all Sennheiser headphones which I have used. For the price it's an excellent product. Trendy Design, loved it soo much..

A good product to buy. The best feature is the mic and the braided wire (at the lower section.) which will not tangle easily plus it has a velcro strap as a cable organiser to hold the wire. You get a good bass, sound is quite clear and even the build quality of this product is good.Do buy if you are looking for a good, comfortable and stylish earphones. The orange colour looks fab.

For the price 399₹ this earphone is a great value for money product . The material and look is not so expensive but the amount the bass from this is excellent and the sound quality is also good . The thing I don't like is the end of the pin area can be broken easily after regular use i think you understand what I mean. Rest is fineEdit: After 4 months normal use one side stopped working suddenly😭. Warranty claim was really easy one. They scheduled the pickup for my earphone and  it went to service center (am not sure where it went) and nothing was heard after it 😵. After a long 14 days I got my replacement which is a new earphone in a simple package 🤑. Even though I missed the cover and package and only thing I had was earphone and purchase receipt 🤧.A big thanks to boat for the replacement....😚😚😍😍😍😍I hope a ""helpful"" for the edit and review 😇

It just an average product, may be due to its low price. Built quality looks cheap, MI earphones in the same price range looks better than this. Cable is good compared to ear buds.Sound quality is average. Though it says super bass headphone, the bass is just normal, nothing super. The vocals are not that crisp and clear. It gives feeling of cheap earphone. If you just want it for occasional use then it is fine.

It's been almost a year!!!My people,  I kid you not when I say that this earphones are the best earphones money can buy!!!And I used skull candy earphones before and these are the  best by far.It does not hurt your ear.They cancel out like 80% of noise or sounds and we'll my family keep calling me,  but I never hear them.Cons:The only con is that the mic leaves a lot to be desired.  If you talk or record using it, the sound has no crispness.  It sounds like you are  recording yourself from under  a pillow.But it's 400 bucks y'all,  take it!!!!

Bought the Made in India one and its good. The length, the sound quality, the look is decent. Also got a pouch and a strap with it.I had purchased boat earphone 2 years ago and it is still work finely just the mic has become less sensitive.Go for the Made in India one instead of the chinese one.Writing after using few days, you cannot keep listening for long ears literally start hurting like a rash. I wish i had bought the previous ones again.

 Built Quality is  good, but does not last long.Stopped working after 7 months  but got new replacement  easily  from service  centre .Stopped  working again, within warranty  period  but now service  centre  is  giving out appointment date when I have to visit again  for replacement. They are asking to come back after 1 month for collecting  replacement  for defective  earphones.After much request gave date for after 15 days.They are saying company is not sending adequate  stocks,they have huge backlog to clear,only then they will give me service.Best not to buy BoAt products  any more, atleast until they can sort out their after sales support.

It's an Okay kind of product... Earlier I had an envent beatz... And this comes nowhere close to that one. But still.... People may have different choices in case of sound... But my main problem is with it's pin design... Earplugs should have an L shape pin... That gives a long life to the headphone... With laptop... Straight pin is fine... But when I use it with mobile... The wire from the pin has to be twisted... And it goes bad within 2-3 months... Happened with my 3 other earlier earphones... Where as envent has a L shape pin... And is working fine... Even after one and half years...

First and foremost thing to remember is the price of this product. Considering that here is what I feel about the product.Build quality: 4 out of 5. Doesn't feel fragile or low quality.Aesthetic: 4 out of 5. The design is trendy.Fit: 4.5 out of 5. Comfortable fit. Even after using it for long periods I didn't notice any significant discomfort.Noise Cancellation: 3 out of 5. I am talking about passive noise cancellation here. It doesn't block out lot of noise. Blame the ear buds material for that.Sound quality: 3 out of 5. It has a neutral sound quality. Highs Mids Lows have almost equal weightage. I mention 'almost' beacuse the bass sounds weak.If you are looking for a bass heavy earphones then this is not it.Button functionality: The multipurpose button does not work as intended. It's good for single click and double clicks. Not 3 clicks. So you won't be able to go back to previous song using the button.Overall value for money. If you are looking for a budget earphone to get the job done then go for it. However if you want good sound quality and noise isolation then look elsewhere.

This is quite an odd-looking pair of in-ear audio . They slide in your ear cavity with ease, but keep popping out much easier. Mine kept popping out frequently. In the loudness department these pointy in-ear cans have enough boom to knock you off, but are not very punchy. At low decibels, the highs and lows behave like a trained canine. Can't say the same after you amp them up to 70-75%. The highs shrill and the bass flatlines. I returned mine the very day they got delivered. What about yours?

Please dont buy this trash product, it did not last even for 2 months. I am a very light user and used this for my online classes but headphone is very cheap quality.  After 40 days, left side of headphone stopped working, two days after it the right side volume decreased very low and then right side also stopped working.  Boat is a very bad company, that is only doing false marketing and i think it just repackages cheap, rejected stuff from China and sells it here calling.

Their is no noise cancelation...2.Their is no magnetics corner like boat 102....*But I don't deserve much more from it...

Boat is a quality brand that comes in an affordable budget. With a BIG name, it comes only @ 400 which is incredible. Delivers performance at par with JBL. The design is very beautiful and unique and the color range is very impressive. Impressive sound quality with moderately good bass effects (come on guys look at the price) Comes with extra ear pads and a velcro starp for holding extra wire length. But one problem that is existent in almost every boat headphone that is, the wiring. It starts malfunctioning almost immediately. Needs very high maintenance. Not very durable.

The headphones are nice and does the job well. Feels a bit flimsy on physical side.Update: i have ordered third one because of the satisfaction i had from my first order with regard to the productGood points:  Worth for the price it offers, sound quality and build quality and color options  One year warranty the manufacturer advertisedNegative points:  The phone number for  registering the product which comes in the warranty card says this number doesnt exists and they are out of service along with a prerecorded audio message  The url for registering the product over website - provided in the warranty card, is reachable only if you are lucky, else site not found error is the result, could get the site only after 5 to 6 times trying  When registering the product the message says you will get a confirmation over phone as message and as email, though its been weeks after registration i am yet to get any sort of communication confirming the product is registered, hence blindly believing the comments by fellow customers that manufacturer will respond when contacted for warranty issues( will be required in case if the headset is having issues - till now after few weeks of usage there is no issue as such, but heard many had the issue of one earpiece not working after few months of usage, i am yet to reach that extent - not confident regarding the fate)Would request @boAt manufacturer to respond on this and update the warranty registration and customer support other than providing a card along with the product with some non working url and phone number.Reducing a star for the non response from manufacturer post registration of two products.

Bought this product in October 21, regretting this purchase... comparison with the MI headphones.I was using the Mi headphones for more than 1 year now, the perfect design and comfort... (Had gone in the washing machine 2 times and was still working fine the next day. I still have them but the mic is not working.Boat headphonesDislikes1) The placement of the mic is far away from the mouth, so until you get the mic close the other person can't hear too well.2) Personally didn't like the quality and the placement of the headphone jack it got bent, not to mention the headphones stopped working within 5 months.Likes1) Decent bass.

Love these Boat Bassheads. I wanted a easy to use dual purpose headphones which I can use for calls as well as listening to music. Here are my thoughts after using them for a week...1. Look classy in black2. Light and comfortable to wear3. Won't tangle easily4. Solid built quality5. Good bass but not over the top6. You get extra set of earbuds to adjust as per your sizeWhat you may not like...1. Not very loud (you won't hurt your ears)2. Bass is there but it's not like some over the ear headphones3. I'm not too sure about noise cancelling abilitiesNot a deal breaker for me so I am happy wotj them. Sound quality is what matters and not the loudness.Go for it!
"
84,"
Let me begin by adding ""For the price"" -1. Fit - Requires some getting used to, but i managed to it fit it properly to feel the music2. Sound quality - Ok, so if you remove the price factor, these headphones are no better than low end skullcandy ones. Bass reproduction is limited to mostly thumping. You won't get much of that deep harmonic bass. Maybe, for this price, this is what you get. Don't get lured by the price, if you want great sound quality, go for the higher end ones.
"
85,"
I didn't actually like the product. Because it doesn't have any quantity which has been written in the title and the description.Bass is very normal.Earphone quality is also very normal.There's nothing like extra bass. I don't think do it even does have a normal bass.It's has none noise cancellation.The product is ok.I suggest you to add some extra bucks and go for the good model.Overall it's a very normal earphone. If you're not a sound geek. You're ok with the normal earphonws you can go with it. If you are that person who wants perfect sound and perfect frequency you should go for something else.

 Finally writing review about Boat Basshead 100.... I bought the Earphone for my sister as she likes to listen and record songs on her phone. I was looking under 500rs and found this Earphone at first I wasn't sure about the performance of this Earphone but after doing some research I finally ordered it.Amazon delivered it as usually very fast before the time....Now about the Earphone:Like the name suggest it gives you the best bass quality under this budget and  you will love to listen songs on this Earphone. It has  well balanced sound output and if you are a bass lover than this one is for you. Also the record quality and call quality is very good in my day to day usage.It has extra earbuds of different sizes, if you find yourseld uncomfortable after using this than you can change earbud according to you ear. It has premium quality design and material. Wire used in this Earphone is very good and it can be used for a year or two depends how you take care of this Earphone. It also comes with a one year warranty. So, if you're looking for a budget Earphone than go for it.

This is very Good product and durable. Available in multi color as per your choice. I like the product and purchased 5 qty for all my family members.  Would recommend to newer customer to try this without hesitation.Go for it.I got some issue with one of ear plug few days back. Inquired and searched a service center in Delhi in Uttam Nagar as the ear plug was under warranty. They exchanged the product but the supply product quality is too poor, this is not as original was supplied by Boat company.  Feels I am cheated getting the product exchanged low quality. Am happy with the behave of the person who attended for exchange. But Boat is not giving that quality which was supplied at the time of purchase through Amazon.Requesting Boat team to please look in to it please.

Review on March 4, 2022I purchased this mid August 2021 for mom.She used it for her Samsung Galaxy A70.She mainly used it to watch YouTube. It worked smoothly with good voice quality for till mid February 2022( So it worked for 6 months). Then both the earheads stopped function.Since this boAt earphone had 1 year warranty, I raised a complaint in boAt site(Just google how to do it. PS: U need to download your invoice for the order)Once you have raised complaint, the delivery guy will pick the damaged on.after few days they will check it and will deliver us a new one. New one is working good for the same phone.I loved the boAt service. I have heard boAt has a very good service.Review on Aug 30, 2021Good voice qualitySuitable for Samsung Galaxy A70 phoneHave a small pouch as shown in picture

The sound quality is sub-standard. Quite disappointed to hear static when the earphones move even slightly. The wires also seem cheap and thin compared to Mi earphones that I used previously.UPDATE - Demoting from 2 star rating I gave initially to 1 star now. It's not even been 5 months and the left earphone stopped working. I've kept it extra careful these past months because the wires felt very flimsy. My old Mi headphones lasted for 1.5 years and I had to replace them only because my cat ripped one of the earphones. Otherwise it was working great! Never going to buy these again! Also, the ends of the earphones are really quite sharp. Not fun to get poked by them often. The all-round horrible quality is literally adding insult to injury. I don't see why they have to be pretentious and say the original price is 999 and that we get these at a discounted price. 🙄

It's worth nothing  . Laymans piece don't buy it. In fact most of Boats products are a compromise to quality sound.Cheap is not always good, far from even best, especially in electronics.Don't add to e waste by buying these products and encouraging such dubious companies. Wonder why Amazon is hell bent on dumping such wastes in India

Pros:1. Crystal clear voice.2. Good mic, the person on the other side gets to gear sound without any noise.3. Tangle-free cord/wire. The length of the cord/wire is okay (not too long or too short)4. The earpiece fits comfortably in your ear, I could wear it for hours while listening to Audio Books without any discomfort.5. The product looks and feels sturdy.6. The Cors/wire comes with a nice removable velcro strap.7. Speakers of the headphone produce good bass.Cons:1. It is strange, but the product doesn't have any clamp to stick its wire on your shirt. I am habitual of sticking the microphone to my shirt while using the headphones, now without the clamp, the microphone hangs freely touching arbitrary surfaces that creates knocking sound for the person on the other side.Final Word:It is a good product at the right price point, people who are serious about sound quality and are budget-strapped can feel free to go for it.

I ordered this for the sake of communicating when my main headphones fatigue my ears. You obviously hear the difference between a 10K headphones and these, and these do the job. I haven’t used these on my phone (yet) and was only using on PC.Sound: Sound is okay. You hear others clearly as you would on a mid range-expensive headphones. These do not hit the bass as much and has a weird built-in reverb to it. Would give it 4/4/6.5 for Bass/Mids/Treble.Build: Sucks. Wire is not braided and seems fine for the price and I would not pull too hard to plug it off a jack. They yank outta the ear just fine. Driver housing is very cheap built, has some unfinished edges and seems like it’ll be crushed if you accidentaly sit on them.NC: They cancel out sound pretty good, way beyond my expectations from headphones this cheap. The tips themselves are a bit flimsy but they still do the job.Overall: Go for Sennheiser/Audio Technica by spending a little more.

Here is a reveiw of Boat Bassheads 100 for all the fellows out there!I have been using these earphones for about 4 days now. Sound quality is very nice Very good for the price of Rs.400. The price to performance ratio of this product should be 1:1 Boat is really offering a great value and quality! If you are thinking to buy these just go for it dont think too much these are the best earphones out in the market right now for about 300-400 rupees.Pros:Good build qualityGood sound qualityGood looksGood price.Cons:The 2 spliting cables above the microphone could have been a bit thicker.Bass could have been better. As boat says it has super extra bass but it doesnt. I didnt feel super extra bass. But the vocals are very goodAnd the Noise cancellation could also have been better.Thats itJUST GO FOR IT!And thank you for reading till the end!

Sound quality is good at this price. The only thing is, this is the second time I've bought these earphones, and for some reason, they completely stop working in about 6 months. Which really sucks, because then you just waste the 350 bucks, as there's no manufacturer support at all. Noise cancelling works to a good extent, and bass quality is fine. Main con is just that it will inexplicably stop working in half a year, and there's no resolution possible (I did try contacting them through their website but to no avail - I got no responses from their team, and am stuck with earphones that dont work anymore). Pink colour is nice.

If looking to buy earphones under 400₹. You guys can buy these. I have been using them for like 6months now and no issues so far.Even my 3-4 friends bought these and are using them. Earphones are very good and fits in the ears if used the right sized cushions. Doesn’t fall from ears(+ point).Bass quality is also amazing.Noise cancellation is not that good but it does the job under certain conditions.If PUBG players are looking to buy, then please let me tell you, it creates little echo if playing with voice chat turned on.You won’t hear the echo, but your teammates would hear the game sounds echoing from your mic. I have lowered the mic and speaker volume from the game settings and it’s fixed now.All in all... earphones are amazing under this range.

I bought 2 sets of these. One for my sister and one for me. We both love these headphones. Sound quality is crystal clear. Bass quality is great. Noise cancelation effect is very good too. This device is value for money. I love every bit of it. It is brilliant. I have many different audio products from Boat, including their Bluetooth speakers, their Bluetooth headsets and now these headsets and I strongly feel this company can easily give tough competition to international brands like JBL and Bose. Their products are really top quality.Thank you Boat for another great product, and congratulations for such amazing innovations in manufacturing top notch audio devices. I'm hooked, I'm a BoatHead for life ❤️ And thank you Amazon as always ❤️ 5/5

It is a very nice product. I bought it for Rs 399.Noise cancellation is pretty much non-existent, considering it's price that was expected. I really like it's bass and sound quality. It is undoubtedly one of best earphones in this price-range.The package arrived in a nice and appropriate packaging. The box contained a black mesh pouch for carrying earphones, which is a nice addition. It also contained a 'boat' sticker. The earphones also came with a velcro for keeping the earphones from getting tangled. Overall I would say that it is a nice buy for its bass and sound quality. The accessories like the the pouch and velcro are icing on the cake!

Writing this review after almost a year of usage.About the product. The product is nice, offers total value for money. Sound quality is good. Crisp audio with medium bass. Design is decent, not the best in the price bracket. The angular design is something I'm not a big fan of. If you often listen to podcasts before sleeping, chances are this might hurt your ears with angular tip.3.5mm connector has loosened the wires inside after one year of usage. This might not have been the case if it was an L-type connector.And i noticed, after extensive usage the adhesive on the ear buds started coming off. So that's something you should know.All in all, it's a good product. Proved to be a great companion.But if you're looking for a better product. You can go with boat bassheads 103 which falls in the same price bracket, has an L-type connector, magnetic earbuds and (what I'd personally consider a ) more aesthetic design

I've been using this earphone for 3rd straight year and mind you I've used this with so roughness, I put it inside my bag randomly with loads of other stuff, inside jeans pocket, thrown it several times here and there... You know how boys in hostel lives right so you can expect all kind of roughness while handling this and yet both the cups perform so well that even today I use it regularly.I'm amazed by the sheer quality of this product, I'll say this can easily be priced twice and then also it'll be good bargain to get for.YYes it's not the perfect one in terms of bass, sound cancellation but what u expect in a 350 INR earphone.

Looking at the all reviews decided to go for it.So let's start with the Pros:- The build of it is excellent. That needs to be applauded. Strong wires, do not get tangled & are sturdy.- I love the matte black look. Look wise it's quite appealing.- Microphone is good too.Cons:- Dislike the earbuds quite much. They feel hard on contact. And that irritates me to no end. Since after sometime of wearing, it starts to hurt.- Sound quality could have been made better. Somehow it feels like, they stopped making it better right in the mid way of its completion.- The length of the wires could have been longer, that too bugs me.So overall. A basic, decent product. I use it largely for calls. Since it does the expected task. Thus okay with it. But not contented. Because it definitely could have been better.

This is my 4th in-ear headphones I have bought from Boat and stopped working in a a couple of months. The slightest pull on its wires when taking it out of pocket, and only one speaker works now.Something always break with boat headphones. Sometimes speakers, sometimes wire, and then you have to buy another one. This product is designed to break. Why would look for sound quality in your headphones if it stops working in a few months?

Not to mention at 391 INR can't get a better wired one honestly. Earlier was using an old I phone earphones wired variant .. It's around 6 years old, still working, but this one is un doubtedly better and a must buy.... Also reviewed the pouch... Another amazon product... At a bit higher in price... Together they make a great paur, within 500 bucks.

No need to waste one's money on expensive headphones unless you need it for a super specialized reason. These are wonderful earphones with good design, excellent sound quality and class A packaging (includes a transparent bag to securely keep the earphones as well). For once, this is truly a case of paying for the ""brand-name"" only if you are purchasing any other when these are available. I want to thank and encourage such companies which are demonstrating that good stuff can be made available to people at large without exorbitant pricing.

Based on reviews i had purchased the same on 24.06.2021. Since day 1 i did not find it much impressive. Can't explain the quality performance in technical terms, but my experience is not good. The other person on that side of phone does not hear me properly. Also the quality of music is not satisfactory with this earphone. My experience with Mi headphone was much better and this boAt  is upsetting when compared to my lost Mi earphone .

Writing this review after 4 days of usage. Sound Quality is not at all good. Noticed that most of the sound comes from left, felt like only left earphone works. Tried different sound outputs, equilizers all were of no use. And about bass do not even think about it, sound was Treble and no clarity.  This product is only good for phone calling but not for entertainment. Waste of money spent, do not set any expectations from this product.

Made in India ( Green )-Love the green colour and the thread design. It comes with a carry pouch too.IPL ( MI Edition )-I like the blue colour.However, it doesn't come with the carry pouch like the Made in India version and also the thread is not there. Everything is rubber/plastic. The problem with that is the climate here (in Kerala) is really humid. These kind of items get really sticky if stored for some time.On the whole, this item is great. The sound quality and bass is good. For a product at this range, I think its amazing.

Got this in lightning deal for Rs.300 and for the price this is the best earphone you can buy right nowThis is a very great earphone with a good quality sound, but it's not for rough usage! The sound is flat, so less bass in regular condition! But the earphone has got a very good frequency range. So still a deep bass is possible but with an equalizer. You can try my preset. Also remember that the quality of sound also depends on your device's sound card.This is a very great earphone with a good quality sound, but it's not for rough usage!

They, then, picked up the earphones from my address, and sent a brand new one to the same address in two weeks and free of cost.

Given the price, its true value for money. The bass is deep enough. The clarity of music is great. All the instruments in the song can be heard clearly and distinctly. Its a great sample of the potential of boat. I would highly recommend this earphones for testing boat's sound quality and later consider it to buy costly speakers of boat. Also would highly recommend it for those who have lower budget for earphones.For gamers:  The surroundness of the earphone os good for gaming both in PC and in Mobile amd would say not many earphones at this price can give such output.

Build quality is good but performance is not. Sound quality is under average & imbalance (base is improportionaly high). The anti-tangle features, I found, makes it hard to coil while putting into pocket. Rubber buds are a bit hard causing discomfort & sometime pain in ear. The biggest issue I have with the design is the placement of microphone which is in the middle & way down making it very uncomfortable to speak (& the other person to listen) comfortably. Another big issue is the unavailability of the 'return' option.NOT HIGHLY RECOMMEND

These are my second boat bassheads 100 earphone's as the previous one bought just a month back stopped working one side,Thanks to the warranty boat arranged pickup for the product and I hope they'll replace it or sort out the problem,And about the earphone I actually loved them, They're good for listening to loud music and good bass, Though noice cancellation is on the downside of it but still, What'd you expect at this price point,I got another one because I couldn't wait for the previous one to come with warranty.

I am writing my honest review approx after 1 month of usage. I felt the following points about this product:PROS-------1. The bass is good.2. Pocket friendly earphones under 400 bucks.3. Premium look.4. Separate pouch from boAt. (I didn't find it useful though... lol)CONS-------1. The wire is not tangle free and seems delicate. So not very suitable for kids or for any rough usage.2. Treble is not that good. I have another one from redmi and they are of same budget and they are pretty good when it comes to bass, treble, i.e., overall sound qualityAll in all, a very average product. The ones who can handle it with care can surely go for it.

The build quality is worst then a cheap 100 rupee earphones so if you want to buy a good quality earphone this is not for you.Pros:-The sound quality was goodNoise cancellation was quite good as far as price is a concern.Bass quality was also good.If you want an earphone where the only sound is your concern then go for it.Cons:-Build quality is where I dont think they worth our single penny.Customer service is so bad.There is no proper way to contact them or seek help.If you can handle earphone with so much extra care go for it else pick something else.

Bass is good.1) Sound in right earphone disappers and comes back randomly2) Even slight movement of the earphone cable creates loud distrubances in earphone.This phenomen is called ""Microphonics""3) Not date of.manufacturing and no date of import found on package4) Old packaging and manufactured in China5) In my experience even cheap earphones will be better than this stuff dumped here.6) Bass is good.

The name Bassheads is not appropriate for the earphones.  The sound is high on the treble band and low on the bass.  So high is the treble at it hurts the ears.  The sound quality apart from that niggle is quite okay.The build quality of the product is good.  Comes with a storage bag and extra earbuds which is appreciated.On the whole, the product is fair at the price being paid. Expecting more is a folly.

Its a good product specifically for official meeting such as Microsoft Team, Skype and so on. Bass is quite minimum.  I don't find it very good for music purpose. Second it has not mentioned which is right or Left ear peace thus needs to adjust due to its shape.But I am good with this as I had bought it for office meeting purpose which is fulfilled precisely.  Sound quality excluding bass effect is very very nice.

No  doubt, it's Sound quality and noise cancellation is really good. But on the very first day itself one side (right )of the ear phones stopped working. I was highly dissatisfied and disappointed. So I strongly recommend NOT to buy this product. But I returned the item and I got my refund also.

As per me you guys should go for mi earphones as this boat earphone sound chamber is made of plastic which can not create a good sound environment but in mi earphones the sound chamber is made of metal and even the base quality of mi earphones are best as compared to this earphone. As I have used it, the base quality is worst. So I recommend you guys thst prefer another earphone rather purchasing this.

I recommend boat basshead 152 it's best.Like- clear sound, with pouchDislike- worst build quality, worst sound,Overall don't buy itIt's the worst earphones I have ever purchased. If you are music lover than its not for you. It sounds clear but background music is very low. It will not make you feel good, sukhi sukhi avaj hai. Pin is also not l shape it is available in others. It sounds disgusting. I don't thought that boat earphones are so poor. if you are student and want to listen lectures than its very good other wise it is a waste. Please don't buy it.

Expected a better quality from this companyThe only  purpose being fulfilled by these headphones is of microphone which was not working in my portronics earphones though were still way better than theseI'll suggest to go with 102 , though you'll be spending an extra 100 bucks  but it'll be worth it as I've been using it for almost 3 months and they're much better than theseThese have lower bass, Hi- end (High frequency range ) is to high, it tends to hurt the ears a lot.

Excellent In ear headphone in this price range. Looks great and fits very well in ear (does not fall easily). It's very light weight and has a tangle free wire which is also a plus point. I have a boAt Bassheads 225 which is about Rs 500 and I felt this is better than that for Rs 350 due to light weight and non slippery in ear fitting design. I did not find a big difference in bass between 220 and 100. Maybe I was not playing high bass music!
"

Before these headphones I have used Sony, JBL, Samsung, Mi and Philips earphones. Of all these the sound quality of JBLSamsung and Mi was better in terms of bass and distortion. But they cost me about 500 to 700 Rs.So for the price this earphone is good. Not.the best but if you compare with other budget earphones the sound quality is decent. Not too much base and not a lot of distortion. But I don't ENJOY the thump as I did on the JBL or Mi or Samsung.Can buy if you are not crazy about getting the best sound quality. Decent buy.

This headphones have mind of their own. For the first 10-15 minutes there is no problem at all. Then what starts to happen is the volume starts to decrease automatically right down to zero. I can actually see this happening on the screen as it is decreasing. Even though I try to turn it up it is battling with me & wants to turn the volume down. I don't tend to get this problem with the other headphones I have.My brother have the same headphones with different colour and they work perfectly fine I don't knw what's wrong with mine

Not bad for 350rs. Good quality but not great. The thing I liked most is very comfortable with my ears which is the problem I face with other famous branded ear phones I have. So I end up using this product more than others. I use for official purpose to attend calls. If you are music lover then I suggest go for other branded which are bit more costlier than this. But this is definitely worth the money.

About Product- First I am telling about sound quality. Sound quality is clear and amazing. Design is also some different so looks good. It's comes with 3.5 mm audio jack. You can connect it with your mobile phone as well as computer. A quality earphone from boAt. About Warranty- Product comes with 1 year warranty. For warranty you need to register your product online on boAt website. It is simple. Company replace defective earphone under warranty period. Company pickup your defective earphone and replace it after checking the issue. So no need worry.Good experience with this earphone and with warranty also.

I've had these earphones for around 1 year and 5 months now and they are still working just fine. I honestly did not expect them to last this long (expected them to break in a few month's time). This is my first product from Boat and I'm very impressed.Given the price, the sound quality is great, the bass is emphasized but the mids and highs are not drowned out. The build quality is also surprisingly good. The cable from the mic to the 3.5mm jack is especially thick. The right earpiece came apart at one point but I was able to fix it easily with some super glue and I haven't had any other problems so far. I find these are far better value than the Sennheiser CX 180 (which used to be my preferred budget earphones), these sound almost as good and cost only about half the price. These also lasted much longer than any of my CX 180s.UPDATE: The left side stopped working. So in total, these lasted me around 1 year and 6 months, which in my opinion is a very good lifespan given the price.

This is my second buy of the product. First one lasted over a year and a half with no complaints, which is a lot for the price paid. The new one stopped working in one ear within 2.5 months of use, which was disappointing. So contacted Boat support and received a replacement within 2 weeks or so. Extremely good after sales service. They work fine for now, let's see how it goes! Bass is good, okay for office calls.

On first look, I though how would it fit in the ears. But the design is very convenient and comfortable. The ear pieces fit to all sizes. The design is such that the outside ambient noise is filtered and what we hear is pure sound through the ear pieces. It has a button near the chest area, which can be used to pause music, skip track, hand up call, which is very convenient.A tip to all buyers :If you adjust the sound equaliser in your phone (player), you can enhance the output with added bass / treble, as per your choice. It has a convenient velcro belt to wrap it back after use. So value for money. No cons.

I usually buy the same earphones when it breaks (obviously) but when my usual one broke, I  started to look for another one, so usually I buy the boat bassheads 225 but this time thought well let me try some different ones so I started looking around and to be honest I only looked the ones offered by boat because their prices are good and value for money, so anyways I ordered this one (boat bassheads 100) because there was an offer on it and it looked good too, also good reviews, rating. but when I actually tried it on for the first time............it SUCKED, I mean not TOTALLY bad.......but OKAY, because it was overpriced. so all I'm just saying is that if you need earphones URGENTLY they're okay. but by my advice go for the boat 225 they are far better and worth it too.

See I won't stop you from buying this but god damn I've ran through 4pair of these in last 3months each i couldn't refund when they stopped working so I suggest save some money up ok buy a good one with proper warrenty like ones from sony or senheisser, these with their flashy price point don't match up in longevity at all I suggest wait and save up for 2 months and buy from aforementioned  ones and I don't mean that the entire boat line up these headphones specifically as for their lineup idk

Well we did try to give a ""branded in India"" a chance, with no restriction on budget I tried these ones after much hype about the brand and sorry to say they did dissappoint terribly. One side stopped working exactly to the date of purchase. Now for a 400 rupee earphone to stand in line at the service centre during the pandamic is seriously not hapenning. Will donate them to my next weeks charity box. What a waste really!

Product is really good, sturdy and durable. However, few things I will point out:> It takes few seconds in buffer, even after plugging in. So if you played something not to be heard by people around you, make sure first it is ready.> The noise cancellation is sogreat that it sometimes cancels the actual voice when mic is little away hanging, and you have some fan's noise around.> Other than these two things, the product is good, strudy and reliable. If you want to consider, The product from Mi at the same range has proven itself up to the mark.Thanks

Earphone quality is good by:1. Sound quality for phone call as well as music2. Gain across frequency spectrum of music is decent, i.e. will enjoy the music with balanced bass3. Material quality is good, not heavy and good fit to ear.4. Wire is also normal good.Mic is good for taking calls. But not even close to good if you like singing or vlog recording.

They go very well with my Samsung. Snug in my ears, very good sound quality and listening to music is a great experience with them. Listening to audio books is even better and that is what I bought them for. Listening to Sherlock Holmes and Yes Minister currently and a very enjoyable experience. The Holmes experience is amazing because Stephen Fry does such superb jib of narrating!

Good, no nonsense earphones, with good clarity and good bass,the mint color is very soothing and a good relief from usual black, white and red gadget colors. Earbuds fit well and are light. The cable is soft and feels durable, earphone pouch is thoughtful, but could have been of better quality. The valcrow for cable management is also very thoughtful and useful. A good buy at 400 Rs.

Stopped working within 20 days of purchase. I tried checking for warranty claim but it is very tedious as there is no option to speak to customer care support, no revert on email. They will ask you to raise complaint on website which will give you address of near by customer care center. Which means you have to personally visit without having clarity that your product will be replaced, repaired etc. For me it's 2 hrs away which currently is not possible for me to travel in given situation. Utter waste of money.. cheap product.. pay bit more and take quality stuff..

It's good. I have purchased this one for the fifth time and it works atleast for a year. It is sturdy and durable. The sound quality is fine but not really that great. You should go for higher price earphones if you want an amazing sound quality. The services provided by boat is also good just in case you have an issue with the product. The previous one I actually washed it with clothes and it still managed to work. If you want quality then this is it.

I purchased this around 4 months ago. Used it for 3.5 months continuously. These are the things that I noticed:Sound quality: 5/5Crisp, clear and undistorted sound way better than boult loopNoise cancellation : 5/5UnmatchedComfort : 5/5Most comfortable one out of every earphones I usedBass : 4/5Perfect balance of treble and bass. Bass is not like super heavy but it's perfectly balanced. I listen to raps mostly and I think the bass is good enough.After 3.5 months one earpiece stopped working so I claimed the warranty which was super easy to do. They picked the product same day without any question and get me a brand new with all the accessories + 1 pouch (which I didn't get with my original order) after 1.5 weeks. So kudos to boat in my opinion boat provide the best after sale service.

They work fine and I love how long the wires are. I bought two one for me and one for my friend. After using it for over a year, my friend's earphone still work but only on one ear. Mine works just fine but I'm sure it has to do with the fact that I keep them in a case and handle them in a gentle manner. I must say that the microphone isn't that sensitive and it's placement is also very low. You will have to hold it upto your mouth for the person on the other end to hear you properly, defeats the ""handsfree"" aspect of having an inbuilt mic.Overall I'd say excellent for the price but average as a product compared to other earphones.

Hugely disappointed in the build quality. It worked fine...good sound clarity, nice bass, good fit and cords etc. But one of the earphones stopped working with about 3 months' use. Looks like there is a loose contact and I get the sound when I fiddle around with the wire/cord of that side, but it doesn't stay. Very disappointed. This is the 3rd Boat earphone that this has happened in. Not buying this brand anymore.

Best quality headphones at 499. Real quality headphones while playimg music with quality I mean not just bass & treble effect what I mean is the 3D effect if an music possess one where a sound of object feels far 110° and closing towards you it can be heard and felt. Another experience is while watching action movies bullets passing by my left & right ear, a granade bouncing just a meter away next to me can heard clearly & now best part in GAMES I played Call of duty: Mobile & PUBG: mobile the sound experience just like actual gamer need. Like the granade effect from movie in Call of duty there were many moments where I could here enemy foot steps running to wards me & I am in corner waiting for enemy. In PUBG there was moment where I could here enemy foot step next to wall where I was taking cover judging from his foot step I assumed opponent must be crouching & judging his final crouch position guessing the position I jumped, aim & fire the target was at exact same location where guess it would be, the effect produced by headphone were so accurate just like real life sound. This headphones produces sound which is equal to gaming headphone. Seriously worth a buy you are not buying just headphone it is a mini gaming headphone. Go for it. I am not exaggerating just sharing my headphone experience. I brought red one.

I gave a 5-star rating when I bought this in Jun'20 but had to change the rating to 3-star because the left earphone wire broke down a few weeks back. It's not even been a year. It looks like the wire will soon get completely detached from the mic area. I used this earphone very carefully, always made sure none of its wire was ever pulled, never kept it in my jeans pockets. I even used a case if I ever had to carry it anywhere. But still, the wire broke down.Rs. 100-150 roadside earphones at least works for a year or so.  What's the point of buying an earphone from a brand like Boat and paying Rs. 400 for it, if it can't even work longer than a roadside earphone?

It is no wonder that this earphone is #1 in best seller (as of 27-03-2021).  I'm writing this after 2 months use and this earphone is absolutely great both in terms of build quality and sound quality.  The bass quality is really good and we could say it is great for its price.  The earpiece is also designed neat that we don't feel anything uncomfortable even during long use.This thing is really an awesome in-ear headphone.

Not satisfied. After using the product for 1/2 month.one side of of the ear phone became non functional. Company had given false customer care number which was not reachable.

Good earphones.Funny story. My Previous earphones completely died and I urgently required a new one due to work-call purposes. I came to Amazon, typed ‘earphones’ on the search bar, purchased the very first item on the list without even reading details or specifications only because I urgently needed it for work. I barely read what brand or what features it carried.The product gets delivered to me, and when I opened and saw the package I was like “When did I buy boAt”? 😂.I didn’t even realize what company brand it was when purchasing as I was in that much of a hurry. I was happy when I saw that it was a BoAt product.The earphones are amazing, good sound quality, nice effective bass tones for music, mic works well for calls on phone as well as for video conferences over the laptop. Overall good product. Go for it. 👍

For the price tag, I'd say it's awesome. But there are many things which bother me enough and are worth mentioning here.1- The design is sturdy but the hawk design of earphone's tail can severely irritate you while sleeping with it.2- The sound quality is fine for low to moderate volume level. But it becomes progressively unpleasant as you go higher volume levels. It actually hurts at high volume level.BUT the bass is very impressive and it is calibrated well for all volume levels.

This pair of earphones is just what I was looking for. I use them at home during bedtime, meaning there are many times I snag the cables and twine them in my sleep. However, this pair didn't give up on me yet.Sound quality is average but clear enough. You get just one button for play/ pause OR Answer/ Reject Call. No volume control buttons on this wired in ear earphone. They sure are value for money!Please share your opinions and reviews so that customers can make informed purchases. Use the tag #AGB for Amazon Genuine Buyer

I have ordered and received blue and green headset's today . The green one comes with a pouch one comes with the pouch. In both the bass quality is good. Mic works fine in both. However you can see the green one has a  cable different than the blue one. I like the blue one much better even the sound quality of the blue one is good I will will write feedback after some months of usage.Cons : It doesnt come with a clip. Earlier I was using Boult headset with loop and I like it more than this with respect to fitting. However boat headsets I feel much more reliable. Let's see.

These earphones  are just amazing, you get more than what you excepted.The base you get is good but the overall sound quality is outstanding it fits each and every type of ears and thy are really comfortable you get a lot from this product at this price point , at my time it was near 350 it keeps its price between 350-400 only but if you want something extraordinary than you should go for realme buds but obviously there price is between 550-600 a bit higher , coming back to bass heads 100  they look good , they sound good and even fits good.  Hope this review was helpful to you.Recently  I have ordered this again  but in white colour earlier  i was having in black there is no problem i just need 2 pair of them

It's been over 4 months I am using this headphones and I love them. It's sound is of high quality and the bass is over powered. I love it's simple yet unique style and it easily gets fit in the ears and I don't feel any pain in the ears even after using it for longer periods. Once again thank to the bass quality for being so boom boom. It's far better than the Samsung earphones which comes around the same price. It's perfect for meditation as it cuts out all the external sounds ( you can't even hear someone yelling at you). Under the price of ₹500 it's the best one.

This is my 3rd peice ordered,prior ordering for a change,I tried Boult Audio BassBuds Loop in-Ear Wired Earphones with 12mm Powerful Driver for Extra Bass with Customizable Ear Loop & Mic (Red)which is utterly Disappointing.Hence got back and ordered boAt 100 which is the best quality in terms of audio quality may it be vocal or bass.For any one looking for a cost effective earphone without any hesitation just GO FOR IT.

One of the best headphones I've used in this price range. Gaming, music, calling everything runs super smooth with these. The only slight problem I've faced is that the microphone seems to be too far away when calling, I can adjust the cable so that it's closer to my mouth but a small clip could have been a wonderful addition.Sound quality - 4/5Microphone quality - 4/5Bass - 4.5/5Cable durability - 5/5Design - 5/5Comfort - 5/5Loudness - 3.5/5Verdict - Go for it! One of the best in market when it comes to performance.

I was searching for a good headphone and suddenly I came across this one. After using for almost 2 month, I would say this is one of the best headphone available in the market. Clear sound with good bass makes it extraordinary. One of the striking feature is this one never twisted haphazardly. Also you get the MI logo printed on this. It comes with accurate blue colour with mic and calling control button. Decent product.

I bought it in Sep-2019 and today the first problem occurred. The left side stopped working. Some lose connection or wire cut issue it must have been. Bought for 379 and used for 16 months. Not a bad deal. But I wish it worked few more months.Product is overall good.Sound quality/Bass - 4*Life - 4*Cost - 5*P.S. In general, this typical problem should be fixed by all headphone makers. It feels bad to throw it away while one side is still working.Edit - Bought it again in Jan-21

No bass, moderate high, good mid. Don't expect miracle in cheap price. It is light which cuts down ear fatigue and the mike is good for teams call. Pink looks attractive for some. Packaging was better than most of the the earphones in same range. You get three pairs of eartips, they are soft and not very uncomfortable. Overall VFM.

My husband bought this product in Dec 2019 and his usage is very rough and heavy in spite of which it lasted for 8 months which I would say is quite decent given his usage and atthis price range. He has used headphones from several manufacturers in the past and all in the range of 500-700 which have lasted for only 6 months or less, the only exception being his Panasonic RP-TCM125 which he bought for 699 and used for an year. This product is total value for money which I would recommend any day.

Boat again doesn't fail to give you the best sound experience. It absolutely rich and clear with a great bass and almost 80% noise cancellation without music and 100% with music. You get a netted pouch as well with extra buds which is something no one does nowadays. Honestly it's a big plus for me because I tend to use small ones and my dad likes bigger ones so both of us can use it without any discomfort. These are wired and need a headphone jack (3.5mm) so make sure your phone has one too.

I got these for 399, and for that price these are pretty darn awesome. However it's not all awesome, it's got some flaws too. So here's the brief analysis:PROS:1. Awesome sound quality and great amount of bass.2. Good microphone.3. Earpads which help you put these things right into your ears, and they don't fall off, don't hurt your ears and you can lay down and jam to your songs with no problem at all!4. Button functionality which lets you accept/reject calls and navigate through your music tracks without having the need to unlock your phone everytime.5. Convenient cable length.CONS:1. Three consecutive short presses, which supposedly should switch to the previous track as mentioned in the manual in fact skips the next song and plays the song after that. The other button functions work fine. Don't know if it's a problem related to my phone (running a custom rom), or the specific item I got.2. The bass is quite loud, but sometimes it is a bit distorted. It seems as though the earphones force extra bass out....Again, for only 399, it's a great product. 4 stars ,only for the three short presses button action defect (and you don't expect great bass at such a low price). Nevertheless, these earphones live up to their name.

It is actually unbelievably durable and long lasting, today i am writing this as my product is now more thn two years old n i have used it in every rough way possible, during bikerides, in the bathroom n what not but the whole build stays together it is still working very fine. it has been pulled and chewed by toddlers, soaked into water also still going storng.

This is my second one, first one lasted for nearly 3 years after which the left earphone stopped working. Didn't want to go for any other model or any other brand as had a good experience with this one. It's cheap (almost half the price of JBL) and gets the job done.. Sound quality is good and clear, not too loud. However, if you're looking for greater bass go for another model from Boat or maybe JBL.Just one con - microphone has to be held near your mouth while speaking else the listener complains of no/low sound.
"

Pros1. Very Comfortable in Ears.2. Good Sound Quality.3. Fits Properly in Ears.4. Look Wise Also Good.Cons1. Mic is so Far, so have to speak loudly.Suggestions1. A clip Should be Near Mic, so anyone can put the same on Tshirt or Shirt, so voice will be clear or change in design to make the mic near mouth.

I bought both Boat and Realme buds2. First I ordered Boat thinking that it's a good brand. Later I took a bet and ordered Realme bud2 as Dad took my Boat earphone.For my surprise Realme bud2 got everything better than this Boat earphone.I thought Realme is not so good brand it surprised me. I wanted to return Boat and get Realme but Amazon got only replacement and no refund.

Frm my prsnl point of view i can't make sense as to y this product is having such a good review where the company assures it with a very good 10mm driver feature to which i practically found my Boult earphone at a very similar price range to be absolutely working much better in base unlike this one... choose any other better Boat earphone 100-200rs more than this one... don't buy this!

These earphones are pretty good for their price. The servicing is a whole other story, unfortunately.One of my earphones stopped working after about 6 months of usage, I called the service centre to claim my warranty. However, they said that they DONOT service this device and will only service bassheads 200/225/250. Really disappointed. The warranty on these earphones are absolutely useless.I reside in kolkata and this is the scenario here, can't tell about other cities.

Received this headphones of Boat very recently. This is my 2nd purchase of the same product but this time, the other end i.e. the PIN which connects to the port (hole) of the mobile is not getting fully inserted. Tried it on 4-5 different mobiles and have concluded that the PIN has a faulty grip and doesnt get connected properly to the port of the mobile, hence sound output is not there on yhe headphones.Alternatively the entire headphone set could be a defective piece and having given a one year warranty from purchase, need immediate replacement.Can anyone suggest the right channel for getting replacement. Thanks.

One of the best earphone in this price.Sound quality is Amazing for this prize.Built quality is good but not the best.I can say budget price since I can say it's good.I have been using this earphone from past more than a year.

The product became defective [one side not working] and got the same repaired/replaced as was unable to make however, the same defective is again appeared now.  Written to their customer care about  a week ago but there is not response. When the same defect is surfacing, it was noticed that the earlier one was some how repaired and resent rather than replacing during its warranty period.

I have bought the product from BOAT in last week of December and within exactly 20 days . The entire headphones is not working and Amazon customer support is completely horrible, they are asking to reach out to customer support to resolve the issue.Their customer support wants us to come to their office for physical examination which would cost me Rs.250 and reaching they’re for Rs.300 worth of product after proof is submitted.Shame that both Boat and amazon customer support is not able to handle a small product replacement . Amazon as usual wash off the hands for a small product and not sure how we can rely them for big products.

I got these earphones today morning.... I listened to many of my favourite songs for almost 1hr.... The bass n clarity are pretty outstanding.... Light weight with proper fit in ears....Previously I used few earphones of wecool,, muveacoustics,, envent,, etc of the same price range.... Muveacoustics didn't work for video calls in particular,, I wonder why,, even bass is not upto the mark....But in comparison to the above ones,, the bass n sound quality are at superior level with BOAT.... Felt these were much worth for 400₹ ....I recommend you to go with these if you want a better one for this price range.....

Unless you're an audiophile & understand the complicated jargon which really few people have a knack for go for this brand !! Its the cheapest yet most durable. You don't have to have any connectivity issues.. I really can't stand those bluetooth ones .. a bit old fashioned that way. The last pair i owned worked for a year and then stopped but for 250 bucks that's excellent.

I usually change my earphones once in two months as they tend to get damaged pretty bad(from inside).I use my earphones almost 15+ hours a day, So often i used to face depleting voice clarity and one speaker getting damaged within a month but this awesome headphones didn't show any problem after nearly an year of rough usage. This time my usage was really rough due to online classes and they still managed to survive. I wanted to buy a braided earphones at first but since this model was on sale @299/- on a specific day I bought it for temporary use. But I still wonder myself that i am still using them as hard as ever. Glad that i made this purchase. Fully recommend this thing if you are careless user like me  throwing headset  everywhere and forgetting to remove before sleeping,etc..

My mother uses it for binge watching TV Shows and Soaps on her mobile, so far it has delivered good performance and she is pretty happy with the usage. The design of the ear buds is not ideal to her ears (keeps falling off often) but the sound quality is great without harming the ears. Deep Bass and good clarity overall.

Sound: 4/5Bass: 2/5Sturdy: 4.5/5Style (looks): 2.5/5Answering Calls: 4/5It has been around 9 months now that I've been using these earphones and they have been upto the price I paid for them. I have use a number of earphones including JBL, Philips, Sony etc, and this product super-seeds every basic model of these 'brands'. I usually use them while watching movies, making calls, listening music, making skype calls, i.e, all the basic stuff an earphone is used for and never have I ever faced any problem.I have been looking over internet for other models as well but the worst part is most of them had a number of complaints about not working after a use of around 6 months. For the last 9 months, I have used these for more than 4 hours per day on an average, carried them in bag with other stuff like keys, comb, pens etc. but they still work just fine.Now.. Should you buy it?The answer to this, pretty much boils down to your need and budget.Who should purchase it?Someone who just wants a pair of earphones that plays the sound decently enough and lasts long at a minimum expense.Who shouldn't buy it?If you want every last details of your music crystal clear with all the bass then you should go for some high end product from complies like Sony, JBL, Bose.If you have a budget of more than Rs 1000 then you can certainly find a better pair than this one, in terms of sound quality.Hope this review has helped you in making a decision for your purchase.

I have been using  boAt BassHeads 100 in-Ear Headphones with Mic for a couple of weeks now with my laptop as well as my smartphone, I have used these headphones for listening to music, as well as for making calls. I am happy with the audio quality when taking calls, or when listening to music. Also, when making calls, the other party hears my voice clearly and loudly. Since these headphones are wired, there's no need to recharge them every night. Good purchase for a decent price.

Brothers and sisters, this earphone has the lowest price in any Ear pieces. So you might think of buying it for the budget, and also it is from a good company. That's where you fall for the trap. The sound quality and bass, and even noice cancellation is appreciated at such price, but it won't last longer than a month. My left side isn't working, and that's the same problem for every user. And the best part is, they don't send you the invoice to claim your warranty. The warranty is a big lie. It's like spending Rs400 for a 30 day trial of the earphones. Try to increase your budget and don't fall for the trap. Trust me, i'm cheated twice.

Hey PeePs.I have been using these earphone from around 2 months.Few point to note.Bass is average until and unless you are using a good equilizer. I am using Bass Booster from playstore.Apart from that quality of sound is better than other products that I used before.There have been several incident that I accidentally stretched the wire but its quite strong also.Only issue I have with the shape of headsets. I can't lie on bed putting these.I will recommend to those people who want an good quality in marginal price.

The sound quality is fabulous however not happy with the service. At first I received a defective product which I sent for replacement which they did on the very next day. The replaced product is fine though I didn't even listen to one complete song. However it seems that the product is used as the earbuds are dirty and the wrapping of the wire inside the box was not like a factory pack. I have shared a pic for dirty ear bud.

This is one of the bad purchases that I made recently. The audio and sound quality is ok. But the microphone is extremely poor.Firstly, the microphone is set at a very low position, so you have to hold it closer to your mouth while talking or else the person on the other side cannot hear your voice.Secondly, Even after tiring your fingers holding the mic, the voice is still not very crisp and clear to the receiver. The mic magically captures all the background noise more efficiently rather than your own voice. Its a nightmare if you are on the road and trying to talk to someone. The person will only listen to traffic sounds rather your voice.Third, there are no volume control keys. Only one button to take or end calls which is also not always functionable. Sometimes you have to press it hard or 1-2 times for it to function. Sadly, there are other earphones available at the same price range(even from the same company) that offers all these features like the Volume key.So unless you do not require to adjust the sound of music, this is a poor choice given the price.Also, this seller does not give you  refund. There is only replacement policy. So once you purchase it, you are stuck with the product no matter how bad it is.Now, choice is yours.

Hello buddies, I'm writing this review after using one month. I bought this below Three hundred and the quality of the product and purpose of the product both are fully satisfied.My suggestion: if your checking this for attending online classes / audio and video calls purpose, definitely this is very good option*Pros: everything like build quality, ear buds, noise cancellation, sound clarity.*Cons: Wire is bit small when compared with other products.Don't expect the bass will be very high but will get decent bass and clarity audio...

Bang for the buck.Using these for a week and had to write a review - Excellent noise cancellation. Fits my ears perfectly. I was using the Apple EarPods before this, and these are much better than the Apple ones.Even when on a two-wheeler, they don’t move much, while the Apple ones kept falling off.Really didn’t expect this much for ₹380!

The sound quality of these earphone are fine. The design is awful. The shape of the buds themselves make them difficult to handle and place in the ear. It is difficult to tell which goes in which ear. The location of the microphone is quite low; while it does ensure both buds are equally effective w.r.t. the microphone. The length of the wire is a little shorter than ideal for me.I wouldn't buy them again.

As my office Bluetooth headphone stopped working and I  was badly in need of headphones for my laptop (wfh stories😅  ) So I got this in early Jan 2021.... must say it worked really well with decent noise cancellation and great sound quality for ₹349 lightening deal 👍🏻👌🏻.

This product is so good 😍 love it very very much the things is that it's bass is very good considering its price and as compared to other earphone at the same level , it doesn't have noise cancellation feature and don't expect you won't get it at this price its quality is like premium better than samsung and oppo or vivo default earphones they have cheap quality but this is highly better that those. further you get a free pouch 👝 which helps and make sure that your earphones don't get lost or winded up and it has sticky  strap which helps to wind the wires of it the colour I chose is pink which is very good . hope this review helps!

I've been using this company's earphones for past 2 years now. I've had to change 3 times but for what the price and service is it's worth it.My earphone's warranty expiry was nearing but it was faulted as one ear stopped working. I contacted support after a bit digging on Google and within 19 days, I got a replacement for a new one for free. No shipping fee or anything. Is it worth it? Yes. Sound quality? Good.Durability - not unbreakable but still, works well even in rough uses.

New Update: I came back to the review to give it 5 stars.

Both got problem after sometime, but when I contacted them, they sent back a brand new headset in both cases. Couldn't ask for more.

I bought these earphones because I needed a wired earphone for my office laptop meetings and calls.It served its purpose.However, the earphones are advertised for music. Just don't buy it if you want to listen to music or watch a movie, even worse for gaming.The sound quality is utter trash. It feels like paper flapping in your ears rather than what I can only imagine is actually used in a proper earphone.There is legit no bass in this earphone. Even after setting the equaliser to isolate just the bass, it sounds incredibly weak.Noise cancellation? I mean, if you stick two earplugs in your ear, you'd probably get better results. Don't fool yourself. It's an in-ear canal earphone, you'll get what you expect.Also, I don't care how stylish this looks, it is just impractical. You can't lie in bed with this. Turn your head a bit and it's gonna hurt. You have to adapt your usage to use it comfortably rather than the product being designed for comfort.

Over all it's a good option to buy. I got in Rs.349. But i thinks of its ear bud become simple design then it might fit in ear and u will enjoy awesome music. One thing what i found wrong is that while buying it was showing its mic is at one side of chord but when it delevered i found it is at junction.

I absolutely love them. They are light weight and work well. I got them at a reduced price during sale.They stopped working after 9 months of heavy usage. I applied for replacement. They replaced it within 10 days. During that I used Ant audio earphones which I got for 600. Honestly, I didn't use them much because they hurted my ears. Back to using these as soon as I got them.So yeah, a very profitable deal for just Rs.200.

Doesn't work more than 3 months. My friend's same headphone worked for 2 months and mine is already bad within 3 months. Bought in June. Mic not working, button also not working.

Totally disappointed. Wanted to buy a Boat headset from long time. Thought of buying this cheap one as a trial so that i can upgrade to higher quality later, i thought. But devastated with the quality.Noise cancellation is NIL. NO BASS Quality too. I purchased for song recording purpose. Not useful as the Bgm quality is heard very poorly. And to add on this chord tangles a lot and causes total annoyance. Not at all good as promised in the page. Regret this purchase.

Overall rating - 3.5 (After 45 days usage by tech youtuber smartphone world tamil)Build: Bad needs improvementBoat bassheads design is not good. The eartips hawk inspired design doesnot work. If we use the earphones to watch movies while lying down on sofa, you will get pain in ears within 30 to 45 minutes.The mic quality is very poor. In 45 days, mic sound quality deteriorated. The button is the worst. No clicky feedback. Need to press multiple times to play or pause the song.Sound quality - Good for the priceBass is good on this earphone and you get decent treble as well. I didnot experience any distortion at peak volume. I have used several headphones in the sub 500 segment and I would say boat bassheads has good sound quality in this segment.

II have bose and bought almost 5 of these earphones only after looking at the vibrant colors in the pictures. But after receiving a couple of them didn't like the color. The colors specified in the images are totally different from what is being delivered. Boat are really cheating on their customers. Thank God I didn't buy the 631 and didn't waste 4k on that.

Short review - broken in a day, too bad audio/mic as well, poor qualityOrdered earphones due to urgent office work and traveling. Only probably was going to need it for one or two meetings. It did not even last one meeting, one side headphones had already stopped working. The mic quality is worse than anything you will ever see. It's cheap but you expect at least some functions out of it.

Fell in love with the color of earphones. They fit perfectly in ears. I have used many earphones but, this stands out in terms of comfort.Sound clarity is great. Wire is long enough for us to have mobile in bag and comfortably have it to our ears.For this price, I guess there isn't any product in the market which offers more value than this.Just go but it and thank me later.

I should admit that i have no extensive knowledge on gadgets, but i have seen people using boAT earphone hence ordered one, Iwas really happy with the purchase initially as the sound quality and product material was good (no tangle) but after 2 week the mic stopped working which was really irritated me. I raised a service request in boAT portal, to my surprise the request was acted immediately the pick-up was arranged next day itself, but  due to my personal reason i could not handover the product, but they chased and reminded me about request and after 1.5 weeks i was able to hand over the product (it was my fault as i couldnt be at home or convenient place for them to pickup the product). After the product was handed over, with in 4 day i got a brand new earphone with a nice pouch ( i really liked that) and it's been working fine for a month now.Over all fantastic after sales service and good product . Cheers

The major thing that I personally look for in a earphone is it's sound quality which wasn't as I expected before buying. If you just need earphone to talk on calls then it's fine but if you are music lover and want good sound quality then Definately this not a good choice at all. It's cheap and affordable but very low sound quality product.

For INR 400, this headset is good. I bought pink colour one. Package is perfect. Delivery also fine. Noise cancellation is kind of okay. I can't expect best one with this cheap price.(purchased on: 25/11/2019)Edit: Writing this after one and half years, It won't lasts more than an year. If you are frequent user, it's life time will be one year. Better for this price range. I have ordered new one today(7/5/2021)

I love them, these headphones are cost-effective and sound nice. It's a good product, like many others have said.Removing one star because Country of Origin: China - wish Boat would set-up a manufacturing plant in India. That's easier said than done, yes, but I would prefer to buy India-made products. When a rival company offers comparable 'Made in India' headphones, I'd buy them without second thought.

The quality of the earphones is pretty decent for this price range.Being a boat product the sound quality is great. And also the noise cancellation.The bass quality is average.However in the long run any one earpiece may stop working. It often happens with these kind of earphones.

1. This is just a terrific purchase i loved the quality of the wires it's tangle free the sound quality is good enough not the best but it's clear .2. I have used Nokia BH501 Bluetooth earphones it's awesome so changing to a wired earphones is not disappointing at all.3. Its good the box comes with 2 pairs of rubber plugs and a soft black foamy pouch the cable length is just enough so no need to worry.4. The noise cancellation is good enough and the best thing is the hands free call receiving button.

These are great earphones for the price. My earphones are really delicate and I had to but new ones every few months. My mom had these in black and they were doing really well so I decided to order these to use with a lightening adapter with my iPhone. The sound quality is clear and crisp and the fit is comfortable. The noise cancellation is pretty good but the bass quality is pretty average in my opinion. But I’m not really complaining because of the price. I bought white (though they tend to get dirty) as they look good with my phone.

the product was awesome ...good in sound quality, good in bass quality...everything was perfect.....but for just 8 months...then it started coming up with problems....both the earphones stopped working ...I registered my complaint in ""boat website"" as it was under warranty period....but the so called popular BOAT COMPANY gave no response.....its 3 months now that i have registered my complaint..but all in vain

I bought these along with MI in-ear headphones in August 2019. These are certainly better styled than MI headphones, but MI earphones have a much better build quality and they cost the same.MI headphones have a metallic body, while Boat has a plastic body.The Boat headphones stopped working in May 2020 - started hearing a lot of distortion and noise for both voice and music.I have raised a warranty request - fingers crossed.

First of all if u r expecting something mind blowing audio experience from this product then no... U must look at the price u r paying to get a  decent and branded product like this one. It gets the job done, it is light , managable , sound is quite nice with balanced bass and tribble ... After using for 3+ hours I felt a bit of discomfort in my ears but that's fine. Over all a nice product to have for casual usage with your phone or laptop.. if u r a hardcore music lover expecting a Bose while u r still broke .... This is not for u... Cheers

Had given this a 2 star rating previously. I had received a defective item or perhaps the quality control isn't that great and you have to be lucky to get a good set.For 399 these are inexpensive and worth the value. I will still say they are bad soundwise, but even if you go for for earphones double the price, the gain in quality isn't that great. I like how they are durable perfect for daily rough use.With Mi earphones the rubber coating starts to melt and smell after a year or two. Let's see how this lasts. Will update if I can.

I'm writing this review after 1 year of usage(pretty much rough usage)...Well it is a good product but after 1 year of time its cable became distorted at the connector point, now it's working abnormally.So, if you use it with some care you can definitely go for a long run usage....Talking about sound quality,, it's decent not that great..Noise cancellation and bass is negligible....Just normal earphones....

At Rs.350 these are almost perfect pair of earphones. You get good build quality, good looks, good sound quality, in-line mic and a pouch in one package. The sound quality is not as good as Skullcandy, or even JBL but you get more features (pouch and mic) and its cheaper. So where these truly shine is value, they're outstanding value for money. Yes you can get better sound quality, yes you can get better build quality, and better looks, etc. etc. But they'll 100% be more expensive and/or cut other features to stay cheap. These are the cheapest and have everything at least good enough. Impressed with BoAt, recommended.

Considering the price which I got it for was ₹ 380, it is extremely good investment of money.Pros:1. Good low and high frequency sound quality.2. Wire Quality.3. Wire do not get tangled.4. Good Microphone noise cancellation  for calls.5. Value of money.Cons:1. Earbuds were very low quality.2. All Earbuds same size.3. Not comfortable and fitting earbudsOverall.I am enjoying the earphones using my older earbuds from creative earphones, works perfectly.

This is definitely a great buy. I am using these earphones for over 2 months now. Their length is ideal. The colour is also as shown in the picture. The earbuds are secure and fitting. They are easy to carry around. They provide great sound quality. They are worth every rupee that I spent on them.

Sound quality is okay considering price of the product.If it is compared with other headphones slightly higher priced product then sound quality is can not be rated as balanced.Mic is goodI could reduce star to ZEROIn my review after 3-4 days of use I have rated 3 stars but only after one month I started facing issues with mic.Sometimes it was working and sometimes No soundI raised quality complaint but service Center in Nashik did not answer call.

It's a decent budget earphone. I have the Audio Technica CLR100BK and although the Boat has more bass, I found the sound quality and vocals a bit mediocre when compared to the AT. The bass is thumpy and not overpowering. Overall, the average audience will love this earphone for the price it's selling for and the punchy bass.

So I bought this a couple of months back. In a month, noise distortions started and then the left side eventually stopped working. And in the coming month the right bud stopped working as well. I did check if it was my phone's issue, but it was not. So frankly it must have worked well for just the initial 2 weeks and then some or the other issues started.I am not the best person to suggest which one you should go for or give you ideas but one thing for sure that I would like to say is - Dont waste your money on this(I did and I regret) :(
"

So I ordered two of these, one in white and another one in red. The sound is not that loud as with full volume I was able to hear people talking beside me (my way of testing how loud the headphones can get :P)Strangely the white ones sound better than the red one on same phone on same audio.The white ones have more bass compared to the red ones but don’t know why such thing should happen. The JBL ones are much better which I have been using and cost ₹200 more from this.

After using for 3 months :One side of the earphone stopped working. Had a complained filed.The product was picked up in 2 days.Now it has been 30 days and my product is nowhere to be delivered. Meanwhile I keep calling to customer care and they keep telling me that they will respond back within 24hrs to 48hrs within working days.30 days since pickup !! That's many many 24hrs.

I bought this earphones last yr on 25th Aug 2020 & here I'm reviewing it after using it for more than 1yr. Trust me this is one of the best earphone in this budget, & the bass is just awesome. Acc to me,Overall rating - 4.4/5Sound quality - 4.5/5, cause sound is kinda lil bit blunt(very slight) due to heavy bass setting otherwise it gives crystal clear sound.Noise cancellation - 4.7/5, it's kinda ok type in this rangeBass quality - 4.8/5, bass quality is just awesome but still I'll give it 4.8 cause it's best in this range but definitely not the best one as compared to heavy bass earphones/headphones.Design & build quality- 4.5/5, again it's one of the best earphone in this range, but wires are a bit thin, not tangle free & not for outside usage.Mic & In-call noise cancellation- 3.8/5 This is the only con, while on call I have to hold the mic near my mouth for talking otherwise the person on the other end says that they can't hear me properly & in call noise cancellation is average but not best.Actually I bought two earphones together last yr, one for myself & one for my brother.I've been using it for 1yr now without any issues & it supports both my phone & laptop. But idk what happened with my brother's earphones,the left earplug stops working sometimes maybe cause of his rough usage & it happened just 3months ago. So at the end all I can say that GO FOR THIS EARPHONE, IT'S BEST IN THIS BUDGET & WORKS WITH EVERYTHING LIKE CALLING, MUSIC & GOOGLE MEET/ZOOM MEETINGS & IT'S GOOD FOR LONG TERM USAGE BUT TOTALLY DEPENDS ON HOW YOU USE IT & HANDLE IT.

Sound from one earpiece is lesser than the other one. Ox cable is also not satisfactory, it creates very weird sound. The product is highly unsatisfactory.  It honestly gave me a headache while I was using it( sound quality) . I have ordered the same product before it was good, never faced this problem. Highly disappointing as it is also having No return policy. I would request the department to kindly replace or return my order because this is surely a defected product.

Quality is good especially the bass. It also fits well in ears with no pain even if used for long period. Cable quality is also good & flexible, will ensure it won't get cut easily. Being Made in India is another advantage which actually made me buy this one. Delivery by amazon was fast.

I have had bad experiences in the past wherein I have invested good amount in earphones and only a very few times they’ve lasted longer otherwise in most of the cases within 6/10 months they stop working, either the sound quality goes down or one of the earpiece stops working. So the quest was to find an earphone which comes in budget and has good durability so that even if it malfunctions, my ears and pocket don’t hurt. And that brought me across the boAt Bassheads 100 in-Ear Wired Earphones, and my thirst for a good ROI earphone was quenched.

Packing was good. Build quality is also good. Fits properly into the ears. Sound out put is not bad either.The only issue with this is that mike is not placed correctly. People on the other side wont be able to hear you properly under normal circumstances. You will have to bring the mike piece closer to your mouth using your hands for the people on the other side to hear you.

I purchased the product on October 1 and it is 2 months and some days after the purchases. I will review the product based on 2 months and will further update later.Sound 4/5 Given the price range, the earphones does a pretty decent job.Bass and Noise cancellation 3/5 Personally I feel, this could be improved.The earphones are tangle free that I feel is a good thing to have.Over 2 months, I felt that the sound dropped a little, like once you have the earphones, the sound is powerful and it feels a little drop in the performance over time.Else, great product for the price!

Just read this review and you are done..I know what sound quality is..:)Yes these headphones do have bass but feels good bass on only Bass Boosted songs.Normally if you are listening to any song..there is no bass..For movies it is good.If you want to feel bass in these earphones you have to push them deep in your ears which will cause discomfort early.Ears gonna pain.So for bass lovers it can be good choice but only limitations are.. You have to put them deep in ears and listen to bass boosted versions of the songs...Else everything ok

It's a good headphone indeed.. sure it's not same pink as appearing in image. It's slightly on dull siDe of pink.. but my daughter likes it..On the side of sound..It's to good. .. .

One.of the best .... 👍👍👍👍👍1.Sound quality is amazing for the price 👆2. Built quality is good but not the best but for the budget price I can say its good ⚡😊3. Headphone jack is not gold plated ⚠️😑4. I have been using this earphone from past more than a year and have replaced it once under warranty which was super easy hassel free🎶🎵🎵🎵🎼5. I have used many other brand earphones such as JBL, Sony, Sennheiser,  Philips, Motorola, honor and recently Samsung and I am not a professional but have experience of many earphones so I can say this is the best sounding in budget and very comfortable in shape to use for longer duration.I can definitely recommend this earphones must buy in budget segment. ☺️☺️👍👍

SOUND QUALITYHas nice crisp audio. It has an insultingly low treble which i am not very fond of but its okay if you are a hardcore basshead.Microphone works good too. I am yet to do a full mic tests with all the active noise cancellation fan noises and whatnot. As of now it seems purely good.BASSDeeeeep. I am not kidding, this thing has deep bass. I set the bass booster at 0 and still found it too high for me. In general, a phone sets its bass booster, in the equaliser at around 35 or 40 for headphones and that seemsvery optimal when compared to the other headphones that i have.One good thing is i didnt find any crackles even when there was a huge bass drops, in one of my tests.BUILD QUALITYGood. it is not the best in the segment, but it is more than okay for 400 bucks.FITTING AND FINISHThe product looks refines enough for me. The design was interestingly new, yes but it is a bit uncomfortable to push the earphones in my ear.OVERALLIt is a steal for 400 bucks for sure. must buy if budget earphones with deep bass is your need of the hour.

I got this and started playing songs from YouTube. Shanti People, Vini Vici, Guetta, Nuclyea and what else. On my God, I loved the bass. For 400/- odd bugs you get such good bass, I'm in love.Your ears will have a blast after listening to all the songs I have mentioned.The length of the cord is just about right. Nothing else to say.

Material quality is just like any other headphones there is nothing special or specific about this though its price is 400 bucks.The cable is not tangle free like the boat 225 model. But a band is given along with the headset to keep it from getting tangled. This is the only thing I liked about this headset.Sound quality I must say is the worst. There is added noise to the audio. I think the cheaper models from other brands like Philips and Mi headphones are much better in this aspect. Or it's better to go to the next variant in the same brand boat 225 bassheads instead of buying these.Durability is something that I can't say as of now. As I haven't used it long enough to comment about it.

Its very cheap looking with poor quality just like some 50 rupees earphones sold on footpath.  can't expect much for the price but atleast boat brand has some good reputation so we do expect a bit better earphones than the ones which are 200 or 300. Not worth for the price it is sold and my earphones stops working sometimes. I need to plug out and then plugin to get it to work.

Let's cover the bad points first:1. Sound is not the best.2. This kind of ear fitting is also not convenient for me. This may be a problem exclusive to me.3. The microphone is at a significant distance from your mouth and needs to be lifted up during phone calls.Now coming to the good points.1. It is inexpensive and delivers a fair sound quality keeping the price in consideration.2. The mic quality is decent.3. The wire is sturdy.4. It comes with a velcro strap along with it for convenient storage and to prevent tangles.5. I bought this to use during my commutes and though in sound quality it doesn't even compare to my Sennheiser CX 180, it serves its purpose for daily use.

Good headset for its price. I will give only 4 stars for the mic. Sometimes I am not loud enough for the people at the other end. Have to pull the mouthpiece closer. Casual calls okay. Listening to music okay. Office calls, may be go for something higher. Looks just like shown in image (I bought red)

The earphones are budget ones and they don't last that great.Mine got damaged near the jack area and I had to repair it after returning from the service center multiple times.The warranty is there and they do replace it but it's like a fish market and most of the time the response is that it will come after 20 days.Hence,decided to self repair rather than waiting for so many days and taking the pain of wasting time for replacement.

Posting this review after 9 months of usage. The built quality and tangle free wire is far better than other brands in the market. The sound is awesome when you plug airtight into your ears. The best thing is durability, most of the earphones stops working after a certain time but these Boat Bassheads are made to the perfection. Great product to buy, fits in allmost all types of ear holes. Final verdict: Go for it, it is value for money.

This was my third earphones which i bought last two times as well the earphones got stopped working but as my return window got closed i couldn't return the same.

I was using boat bassheads 225 for the past one year and I thought of going for the same brand again bcos of the great bass experience it gave me. unfortunately, the mic of boat 225 got repaired and went on to purchase this new product only for the mic but the boat bassheads 100 is not at all half the potential of its predecessor. totally disappointed. treble and treble only. I can't sense bass or whatever in this new earphone even at the lower volume level.  ppl should not go for this product if they prefer bass and quality.besides, the mic placement is awful. most of the ppl today prefer to wear their earphones around their neck. the mic placement is made in such a way that goes behind the neck and attending the call becomes uneasy.the button on the mic just acts as a play/pause button rather than call attend/disconnect button.in short, a total waste of money.

My first ""expensive earphones"" and it lasted for more than 2 years with daily use (~4hrs/day).I've never had ear phones that lasted over 4 months, but these ones lasted 12 times longer!These were so reliable that I bought 2 more of them.One of the other 2 got spoilt within warranty, but Boat covered the entire thing and I got a replacement.- The positive thing about Boat is that if you want to claim warranty for their products, they will handle the entire courier/parcel service; they will send a guy to your house to collect your ear-phones, you DO NOT have to go running anywhere.Due to their reliability, and easiness of claiming warranty, I've bought 6 of their products.

See what i am telling you is ""BOAT"" is brand that understand the need of the customer & at 379/- Rs what boat bassheads 100 hawk inspired earphones offers is just awesome.PROS -1) Lightweight.2) Good design.3) Stable Bass.4) Tangle free Wire.5) Good Microphone quality.6) Free Air buds.7) Multicolored options available.CONS -1) Little distortion on highs.2) low durability.If you are low on budget than i don't think you can find better deal than this earphones. So just don't think & go for it..I hope you like my review.

The earphones look pretty good. The sound quality is good as well as bad at the same time. It has a minimal tendency to help in noise cancellation, which is pretty decent in this price range. Now taking about the good and bad thing- the sound is really loud and clear as we obviously need but it can crack sometimes and words seems to crackle specifically if you tune into radio( not due to frequency). In all the earphones are pretty good have been using it for four days now. Can't tell about it's life tendency let's hope it lives longer 😂😂

Tbh i had couple of TWS headphones. But i bough this as many laptops have very weak or bad Bluetooth chip inbuilt hence there will be signal drops regularly.

It's been like 9 months since I have purchased this and believe me I use it really rough. However, it's great that it never had any problem. It's really sturdy and the build quality is amazing. Just imagine I used it during my fitness hours ,in factory,while riding and where not and it go no problems. Coming to the sound quality, it's much better for those who like acoustics and treble. I believe it's not a bass jacked earphone. It has high frequency pitches which when combined with Dolby sound will give good acoustics.Bass - 6/10Mids - 8/10Build - 10/10Comfort - 5/10Not to forget, the eagle design is not good I mean it just iriitates by pricking the inears. Maybe better buy jbl zip20 or Boult X1. Same price butich better.

This is happening 2nd time with me with different headset from boat. The button call button on mic assembly rattles for very simple moment. So much so, you can't even walk and talk with these. The other person can't hear anything besides the annoying rattles.

Everything like sound, bass, length, quality, etc. is excellent. But i think i got wrong piece. I used it for 2-3 days and it worked extremely well. But then its switch started doing wrong commands. I mean to say that every time i plug it into my device it starts giving commands like decrease sound, increase sound, automatically activating google assistant, play pause audio. And pick up and drop is also not available under warranty and j don't have much time to go to centre and replacement by amazon also got expired.Actually i was not in the town when product was delivered and i used it after 14 days of delivery. So i want help with this issue. Otherwise everything is excellent about this product.

The reason I bought this earphone was because of the highlight on it's bass quality by many reviewers. Extremely disappointed to find just an average bass out of the music. I tried mp3s with rich bass but it was not satisfactory (not enough pronounced).The sound clarity otherwise is found to be overall good. But I guess most of the earphones these days are clarity wise alright.

Nice pink colored earphones and actual color matches with the one in photograph.Fitment in ear is good and comfortable for 1-2 hours (but not for long time). Sound quality is good for the given price and suits your requirement of listening music during walking or other work.Overall nice product.

The music with this one is perfectly balanced. The bass is as per the music, no enhanced bass. The vocal is very clear and crisp. A perfect earphone for online meeting.Con:The passive noise cancellation could be better.Not for those who wants only bass in their music.

I purchased this ear phone about 1½ years ago.. This Earphones do have nice bass and sound quality and i was pretty satisfied with this.. But after 8 months or so..Left side of the earphones stopped working.. As this product comes with a 1 yr warranty.. I issued a product replacement and I got a pair of new headphones of same colour. It's been about 5 months since I got this new headphones and now the left side of this earphone too have stopped working.. I don't know what to do..I checked wheather I could claim warranty for this new one.. But there was no option for that... Now I'm stuck with this earphone ans as lockdown has been imposed in the state I can't buy a new one. ☹️

Very much disappointed with the Boat for handling a warranty issue . The product stopped working within 4 months of the purchase . defective item was picked but there is no update of the order . people should avoid this brand and should go for other options . Quality is bad and service as well.

There is no issue with sound quality but I will not buy it again because I cannot differentiate between left and right ear plug. You take any other company earphones they have it written which is for left ear and which one is for right ear, moreover the mic is always on the right earplug. In boat you can't differentiate until u put it in your ear and then realize it's not fitting so it's for other ear.

This product don't last long not even a year. And the ear buds slips out from the ears and have to stick them into ears hardly for them to stay inside the ears, leading to headache. Not so user friendly product and kind of waste of money. less than 6months and cannot hear anything. Unfortunately, i didn't claim the warranty also as i didn't know that i could get a new earphones during warranty.

the Sound from these Earphones, completely suit me. Clear.It Clearly is Worth above the price its being sold, to under 600 earphones if i have to be specific.Durability Might seem to be an issue, will only get to know as i use it. Its not Poor but there are are earphones with stronger Cables.The Cable is really long and its pretty intuitive to find a nice wrap to keep the extra cable in rolles.Mike tested is Good, No problems but doesnt catch the voice from a little far.. reasonble distance and you can speak comfortably, but there's a small issue that the Mike is a bit farther from your mouth. so you ll have to bring is nearer manually or make one earpiece go round your neck to bring the mouth piece nearer.OverAll definitely recommended for the Price. Happy :)

So, I was searching for some average performing earphones in this price range and I came across this product,The first thing I saw was the review and they were negative... Still, I decided to give it a shot.And, here's my experience-Firstly, the box was damaged.  Secondly, only one earpiece was functional and the second one was not working.Thirdly and most importantly, I decided to return it but apparently I could only get it exchanged,I requested for an exchange and the replacement was never delivered. Instead an Amazon associate came upto my house and collected the product I had. And after 10 days of chatting with customer service. I got my refundI would recommend go for flipkart smartbuy, they have really good earphones at average price range.

Sound profile is not well balanced. Ther is no soft bass. Mids get distorted by bass ( still the bass is not that great ). When compare it with other earphones from this price range like Baseus H04 the Baseus clearly wins in audio quality bass and overall comfort.The bulid quality of boat is great for what you are paying. Still for movies the mids are not great so the voclas will not be thet great.  For music I woud not recommend this earphone. If your budget is low go for the Baseus H04 Or even refurbished / Renewed JBLC100SI .It's not fare to compare JBLC100SI with a earphone in this price range , but the refurbished one cost around the same .

i am very satisfied with the product. its very useful for me. especially the comfort and the sound quality, iam very satisfied. its really value for money. i am writing this review after using 4 months . there is no complaint in the sound quality and product quality. i can play pubg very well by using this. very comfortable .  but a limitation i want to say is, its not comfortable for all phones. i used this in other phone. that time its automatically stoping the videos. and when put high volume its very annoying.

Excellent quality.  Wouldn't compare it with something like a Bose noise cancelling earphones. But it is certainly good for the price. Value for money.  Been using this daily for calling and watch netflix and other streaming services. Both audio and skype call performance is beautiful. Crisp sound depening on signal. Movie watching with my Galaxy S10 Plus is a pleasure.  Highly recommended. Have used this on a laptop too for video calling and watching streaming Services. With excellent performance.

I dunno why I went for this one, but the sound quality is not upto the mark I had with my previous headset. I had Boult audio headset before this one and that one really had a better bass than this one!And my problem is one earbud fits good on one ear, but the other one keeps slipping and doesn't really fit in my ear! Lol I donno if this one's on my ear but this problem is specific to me! Maybe it'll be fine for you guys!

Worth the money.Bought it for 349 ₹Go for it if you want budget headphones, the pros and cons as per me are,Pros:They have good build quality (The Earpieces)They have good sound.They have a good microphone.Comes with 1 year warranty.Comes with 2 pairs of additional earbuds (The silicone ones)Worth the money.Cons:The earbuds are kind of small, will be weird fitting them in your ear for the first few times.They have bad wire quality, the wires are delicate enough to break or detach if you pull on it.They don’t have enough bass for bass songs.The earbuds might fall off but you do get 2 extra pairs with it.Thoughts-It is value for money and can go for it if you want a earphones with good quality in a budget, however if you can spare upto 650₹ I’d recommend the sony earbuds, as they have better sound quality.If you are expecting bass from earphones, you shouldn’t as better bass can only be achieved by higher and bigger speakers, so go for over ear ‘headphones’, for bass, however for casual aongs, edm and everything it does have a great punch, I’d give the bass on this a 7.5/10

I have purchased this on 2019 & it’s been 2 years & I thought on dropping a review. In short this bassheads still works (right side is not working as of now) .Design:-🌟🌟🌟🌟uniques design & fits into your earsSound Quality:🌟🌟🌟Bass:-🌟 can’t really call them bassheads cause they are really bad at it.Durability:- Acc. to your usage (Lasted 2 years for me ).If you keep earphones in your pockets like me you are gonna have a tough time buddy (everything wears & breaks out)In short :This thing does the job for the price & design element is good.

A few days ago I decided to buy a earphone within the sum of rupees 500. When I saw the earphones on Amazon it was difficult to me to choose between Boat Bassheads 100 and JBL C50HI. I was confused. So I bought both of them and after using for 2 days I returned one of them.In the next day after ordering the Boat Bassheads 100 was arrived. I used it. It is nice. Build quality was not too much durable as expected in this type of budget. Also wires are not tangle free. Its 3.5 mm pin is not L-Shaped so it's provide some pain when you plugged it in with the mobile and put the mobile in the pocket. Sound quality is nice but little bit much louder with full sound. Bass is lower than I expected. The main problem is the mic. The mic is little bit far from your lips so when you need to talk you have to hold it with your hand near to your mouth, it is a pain when talking with someone for a long over earphone. This headphone easy fit in my ear but it becomes uncomfortable when using continuously for over an hour. Earbuds are also uncomfortable while laying on the bed.After two days of ordering JBL C50HI was delivered to me. Build quality is same with the Boat Bassheads 100. But JBL C50HI has a L-shaped 3.5 mm pin which is comfortable option to plug it in when your phone is in the pocket. Sound quality is more than I expected. Too clear, balanced and pleasant sound. Not too loud just the perfect balance. Bass is superb. The mic of this JBL earphone is placed just beside your lips so you don't need to hold it with your hand while talking with someone over earphone. It is also a perfect fit in my ear and too comfortable for long time usage. I also used it while laying on the bed for more than 3 hours continously it is perfect. In this JBL earphone's earbuds marked with 'L' & 'R' so it is easy to discover that which one will fit in which ear. I just love this one.Therefore I returned the Boat Bassheads 100. Hence I will suggest you to buy the JBL C50HI if you confused between the former and latter.But remember Boat has a 1 year warranty and JBL has a 6 months warranty. Your choice.

Amazing sound stage At this price. I was not expecting such a great richness and bass in the sound. I don't think there is any other earphone in this price range able to compete with this.Only thing i noticed is the cable quality but at this price range it can be easily ignored.Also forgot to mention they included carrying case!! I mean seriously!!! Waooo!!!

These are a decent pair of earphones that come at such a low price point. There are few pro's and con's.---PRO'S---1.Stylish looking2.Good audio quality3.Cable has decent length4.Good microphone---CON'S---1.Earbuds are kind of small (Even the extra buds are not big enough). Due to this they feel loose but doesn't fall out.2.Build quality is of cheap plastic as expected at this price range.3.The bass is a little weak.4.The cable feels thin and fragile.Conclusion: Good pair of earphones for price range, but much better earphones are available at slightly higher price range. 7/10

Very much dissatisfied of the sound quality of Boat-100.Clairity of the sound is very poor.I don't get any return option for this product. Other wise  definitely I will go for return. Only I can go for replacement with same product.Waistage of money.I have purchased two headphone in 399/- one Boat-100 and another Mi basic headphones. Mi has the much better sound quality then Boat.Inform to manufacture of Boat, don't waist your money in Advertisement and others fixtures. Please improve the quality of the product.Quality talks everything no one need to say anything.Very much dissatisfied.

I bought this mainly for talking on the phone, it was a steal deal.Coming to audio quality, it is very good at 75% or below, quality goes down at higher volumes.Good for gaming and music too, the noise canceling ear buds are very good, even if you’ve turned of sound not easy to hear someone speak, so be careful if you plan on using in traffic. The mic position should have been higher/closer, if it is noisy you’ll ve to hold it near ur mouth for it to be clear.Bass is not that great!Go for it without doubts, can’t give better at this price!

Great deal..If you are interested in low budget earphone with normal (not best) mic and better sound quality then go for it.It has good built quality and also musics are much clear..But I suggest you to go for Senheiser CX 180 even though it don't have mic but it's great.But for lower budget and best at that price then must go for it..You will not be disappointed..Thank you!

I got it for 350rs/- for white color. Other colours are showing more price when I am purchasing. I don't recommend this ear phones at that cost. Bass is okay, there is noise cancellation as they mentioned. vocals are okay at 80% volume but if volume is low than that vocals are also not clear. Highs and lows are average. They told they used 10mm driver's but I didn't feel it. Microphone is okay for calls. Overall performance is average. Better go for Redmi basic ear phones that are better than this. If you have more budget for 600rd Realme buds2 are excellent at that price.

So if you are thinking to buye a good earphone is 349 then it is relly amazing with a decent quality of audio which will not broke on the maximum volume but I am not satisfied with the bass quality cause I was using Akg earlier that's having a relly strong bass but it's having 50% of them if you wanna buye this I don't recommend it personally cause its not having a good bass it's sound is cool for cold and soothing songs but if you are a listener of rock then it's relly waste for you to buye

Mic is stopped working with in few days. If you touch the cable you will get the echo. It’s really disturbing.

I am late to review as I came across this again now when I was looking for headphones. dont buy this waste. you think its boat so it will at least last for 6 months at a price of 350 or 399....forget it! 1 month or 2 at max and it will go down drain. one by one each side stops working and you cant hear anything in max 2 months!

I can say I invested in right product. It give amazing sound clearity in such low cost, bass is ok not too much you can feel the base.

Boat is an Indian company so it has double +point. You must try this Indian product.

It's just okay, nothing special, except for the brand name. The sound quality is good for this price, no noise cancellation - you can't really expect this at this price point anyways. I have noticed there is a long latency of 3-4 seconds in this headphone, which was surprising because wired headphones are usually praised for zero latency. But however, I have noticed a time lag of about 3-4 seconds.I would recommend, if you desperately need a headphone - go for this. Or just go for a TWS headphone instead, as the wire gets all tangled up, and at times it becomes frustrating untangling the whole thing.

Absolutely do not recommend this earphone, terribly low volume and bad distortion at high volumes.Treble is too sharp and will most definitely give you a headache after prolonged use.Bass quality also nothing amazing, just average.Many other great earphones available at this price.Build quality also junk, completely plastic and wires tangle easily.Best part of this all is that there is no refund option only replacement.

I have used this product earlier also but this one doesn't seem to be a real one and rather it might be a copy/fake one.Sound quality is very poor, sometimes it hurt the ears and bass quality is also very poor. While listening to music I can't even differentiate between the normal beats or any beat drops.Noise cancellation is comparatively better than usual earphones.

I had bought this earphones(red one) for my wife for WFH purpose. I was really surprised by the sound & build quality. Later after few months I bought one for myself(white). It delivers impressive sound quality(well balanced) for call & music/movies. Only downside I feel is the Microphonics, the sound you hear while you touch the cable or when it rubs onto your clothes. I felt it more on my white earphone than on my wife's red earphone. Other than that, it's a cheap & safe investment, for sound & durability.

Earlier I was using jbl e15 earphones. They were so nice and the quality of sound of mind blowing. Then I shifted to these. And now I've started wearing earphones less frequent. I've started to have pain in the ear. The sound quality is so sharp and crisp. Maybe good for somebody who can handle such sound. It is not suited if you take them for calling purpose.

-Nice sound-good earphones to listen to musicDrawback:While you are already on a call and when you try to insert the earphones, the person on the other side of the call stops hearing your voice. This is a huge disadvantage because you do not know when you will have a long conversation. Once you insert your earphones, then you have to disconnect the call and dial the person with earphones on or you have to just disconnect the earphones and continue holding the phone.

I bought this product to use with OnePlus 5T which is not so compatible when in comes to plugging in. Most of the times it won't fit properly and plug just comes out. Hower, product quality is good. I have used to 2 BOAT earphones till date. No complaints with it.

I tried the boat bassheads and I found the sound quality good enough. Not great but yes, noise cancellation is good. There's clarity and the sound is good enough. But I feel the mic is of 0 purpose. When you plug in the earphones, the mic is not at all close to the mouth automatically. You have to constantly hold the mic since it's down below, just so that the other person can hear you. The mic is fine but it's placement makes it redundant. Like I wouldn't want to constantly hold the mic while I'm talking. And it becomes difficult especially on a WhatsApp video call. So this functionality is of no use here.

I would say, it is a good headphone considering the price. However, if you're someone who is also looking for an even decent sound / music experience - this is not for you.- Calls / Reception / Responsiveness of mic - Good.- Music / Movies / Sound Experience - Need much more improvement.Go for it if you would like a budget friendly headphones but only to take professional calls in your WFH.

The product quality it good, as its shown in the pictures it looks like that only.The packing is also attractive and gives a good and exciting Impression while opening the box.The earphones looks nice the color is niceQuality of the sound is not that appropriate as I am a music head myself I want more base and more sound quality but the sound quality here is pretty basic and nice, the microphone works perfect. Base is less, I hoped for more base but the base is not that much nice, treble is also controlled, it does not pinch in the ear it's quite nice and soothing voice quality is spreaded, it doesn't feel like it's focusing on one point and giving headache.. it's nice and quite okay for basic use

I wanted a value for money headset that I can use for listening to audiobooks and this was perfect. As this is cheap enough to replace incase you missed it and sounded well enough.

You cannot expect noise cancellation at this price point so just increase your volume as high as possible to drain out the noise.

I have used many headphones, these were the most pathetic ones.All your money just goes to a dozen brand ambassadors Boat has paid to use their photos.Boat is not even a product or technology or audiophile company, it's just a marketing company that rebrands cheap Chinese products.The headphones have poor sound, zero comfort, and cheap looks.

Before buying it, the brand boAt is hyped a lot. I thought it would be the best, since there are a lot positive reviews. But utterly disappointed because of these :-1) Noise Cancellation, Even if you are at a pleasant place, you can hear the minute noises even while listening songs from this. Worst!2) Bass Quality, This boAt is hyped for its bass, but through this earphone, bass quality is utterly low. I'm not a fan of bass, thought it would not disappoint in sound quality. But,3) Sound Quality, Very unclear distorted sound at high volumes.  Used Samsung EHS64, Mi Basic Wired with mic, Philips SHE1405BK/94 in the same price range. But this boAt Bassheads 100 is the worst one. Cannot even compare with other best earphones under this price.

The product was good, had bought some products too, while buying the products, the same, was available in prime only for a better price, free trial was offered for a month availed it. After a month Rs. 999 was automatically deducted from my account I was shocked. I called Amazon and checked, they said auto renewal for prime membership. I said I did not opt for it. I don't use Amazon prime other than explicitly buying products that too as featured by Amazon. I don't see movies, use any of the services of prime except buying products rarely when needed.My discussion with customer service team told me it is auto renewal of prime membership if you opt for free membership ( I did not notice or understand it ) while taking it ( may be my mistake I accept it). My Rs. 999 was reversed after painful interactions and escalations with AmazonI am annoied and really shocked that if Amazon studies my foot prints and understand my interfaces with them. I am not an Amazon Prime Customer, there is no necessity and need. They should not recommend or sell the service to me. Going by a Healthy CRM process, understanding the foot prints and buying behavior ( need of the customer) accordingly products and services is to be sold to the customer. In this case just because I went for the free trial and didn't notice the auto renewal terms mentioned therein, money without my consent from my credit card was taken later returned. ( But with an unpleasant experience)But during this pandemic time when Life is at odds. Strategies of Selling, Upselling, cross selling products and services when need is not there is not acceptable, without consent from us auto debiting money is not right. Just because our account detail is at your access, this gesture of yours is not appreciated and sadenning. ( You may say that auto renewal clause trails below, in our frantic attempt to buy products which says that 2 more only  left. All this is not quite Clear, legible, explicit and understanding to the customer )I had held Amazon in High Esteem and Gloried its services and offerings. But now the Trust and Reliability is buried in the deep shallows of the sea and would never horizon again in our minds

The ordering and delivery process was quite smooth. They arrived in a neat box with a pouch to store them securely and also a band to tie the cords together so you dont get it entangled.

The sound quality is average as there is too much of base and no treble but then you can’t expect much at a price which is literally a steal .The newer earphones from the same company have more bass and thump and the clarity of sound is well calibrated.The ergonomics is quite well distributed with its sleek design and style.Overall it’s an average buy and if are that person looking for sound and bass this particular model might not suit your needs but the alternative models could help the cause

The sound is clear and crisp especially when you listen to songs.For two reasons, I’m writing this review:1.

I love sharing my experience about anything. If my advice helps others, good!Good product. You must try it out!

Build quality : 1/5. These are one of the worst earphones I have ever laid my hands on.Sound : 1/5. now, since this is bottom of the barrel price segment, I can let go of the build quality if it at least compensated with a good balanced sound and nope, it doesn't. It's loud enough but there is no bass. I can't put my finger on it but the sound from these earphones hurt my ears.Comfort : 4/5 well, at least they are comfortable to use.

The Best Experience...!!! boat is GOAT !!!! It was an amazing experience as soon as I put on these earphones for the first time hearing the Dolby sound.  Amazing Bass and Surround Sound. Also Quite a Hot Body for a Earphone...!! The Hawkeye Design is unique. After around Two n Half Months, the jack became loose n the sound was disconnecting so I enquired if I could Replace the product for a new one since it was still in warranty period, but had a doubt. But the Customer Support of ""boat"" was Amazing...!!! Got the old earphones picked up from home and was delivered a new one within a week. For under Rs.400 such an amazing service along with ELITE QUALITY.. #boAt_is_goAt 👌🏻👍🏻👍🏻

The sound quality is super awful. Bass is nonexistent. Treble is extremely metallic. Voice sounds the same as treble, like a robotic voice and not human voice. Asked for a return.

Will look for something else.

The sound quality depends on the phone that you are using it for. In general its a good earphone. But the bass and the sterio (sarrounding) vibe depends on the phone for which you are using .. It works well with MI , whereas for VIVO (U10), it didn't suit well (bass & sarrounding was not good)!!

This earphones are really good. Sound quality is good. Bass is also good enough, ofcourse you can't expect much bass in earphones of this range. Earplug fits properly in the ear that you can hear proper sound while travelling in the train. At the same time you're not completely deaf after putting your earphones.  The crape band provided with this earphone is the main attraction. Band helps you to keep earphone roll proper. Also it helps to hold the earphone on the clothes as it sticks to many materials. This helps us to fix the earphone's mike close to our mouth.

Over the years I have used Philips, Sony, JBL & Sennheiser headphones. I like to have good bass in the headphones I use and I was a little skeptical to go for Boat since its new and hasn't yet reached the levels the aforementioned brands are in.But to my surprise, this pair of headphones have surpassed my expectations. It does deliver good audio output for its price and does better than the entrees from other brands. If money is a constraint and need a good pair of headphones, this is a good choice. But be wary of it showing the downsides over prolonged sessions. Afterall it is a entrant and it is nicely crafted to perform as one.

Although the product is good, after sales service is very pathetic. The headphones don't last a year. I purchased 3 pairs out of which only one is working. After 3 months one pair was not working so I sent it to boat service center for repair through their authorised courier but never got it back. I tried calling them but no one answered my calls.Amazon is very diplomatic and indifferent in their response about third party product warranty. I don't understand when you are selling a product then at least you should help your customers in pursuing these so called ""  third parties "" to get thier warranty fulfilled.

Don't buy this product very disappointed 😤😑😐😥 with this product bought the product it was working good for 2 months then initially only one side was working. Somehow managed to use like that but then again the other side also stopped working .Had warranty of 1 year but it was of no use as they said they don't come and collect their product if it's not working we are the ones who are supposed to go and exchange at their store which is usually far away from our homes. Rather than going for warranty I bought new earphones because I had no other choice .. I regret for having purchased this product 😑☹️ two times and faced the same issue literally disappointed 😤.

When connected to my HP laptop for Zoom meeting. other participants could not hear me properly. They were complaining about very low voice of me.When disconnected from laptop and used laptop mic directly, they were able to hear me properly.I cannot return this as there is only option to replace it after return. No refund option provided for my mistake of purchase.

Just good enough for the price but I rather shell out couple 100 more to get the realme ones.Pros:AffordableAcceptable sound qualityBuilt quality is satisfactoryCons:No nylon covering like some slightly expensive onesEars hurt after prolonged useMic is too far out from the mouth. It's quite inconvenient to be holding the mic all the time.Conclusion:If you absolutely can't afford better quality earphones go for these. But I already had Realme buds which are Rs 200 more but totally worth the extra money.

Nothing especial in this earphone other than a third class design and somewhere in minus class of quality. The quality of the cable is in line with ₹15.00 chinese lights we use in Diwali. Noise cancellation is such that dont u dare to listen something private in front of others, the same time there is a positive point that u may also use earphone in speaker modes as you will very well listen what is playing inside of them...Regarding Bass.,,,.why the hell does they and others calling it a basshead without knowing its meaning, no bass as i have used it in both android and my apple...Final verdict is that at price point of view this can be considered a better option if you cannot go to the nearby railway station to buy something better in ₹100 only..And i bought the red colour as no other colour option was available and now scared of taking and showing it to others bcoz of its quality and look...Thanks

It's really good for the price I bought it ₹300.. It's been an year since I'm using these, works great,no issues as of now, great design 👍 looks good, works well but bass is not so good.Basically,  these earphones are good for normal use, phone calls, listening music, works well & if you're looking for bass, will not recommend!

The 3.5 MM jack is not working. However, i dont use the earphones regularly but after using very lesser, it is not working.One more thing to add- The product was delivered defective as the outer skin of the wire near its JACK was broken/torn but I accepted the delivery thinking that it will not make much difference with the overall quality of the product and I am a regular customer of Amazon who believes in the quality of Amazon, more than other online company platforms like flipcart etc. But this time I am disappointed with  the product quality sold on Amazon.

Product quality is pathetic as am  facing lot of issues now .  call is getting disconnected frequently once u start using the headphone as well as sound quality is pathetic . Don't know what to comment on noise cancellations as only noise is heard once you start using the headphone . I bought headphone , car charger and Bluetooth together but I am facing issue only with headphone . Big fan of BOAT and Amazon , but this experience has surely disappointed me . Trying to contact the seller but no response  . No one has responded  from the Amazon customer service team as well ! If Amazon or BOAT  claims to be customer centric pls intervene and resolve my issue

Very much satisfied with thatCons.boAt tells that it has a 10MM driver that delivers crisp and punchy sound but you are clickbated here i have realme buds q (TWS earphone) that has same 10MM driver but has a crisp and punchy sound than this one

No doubt of the product as it is from a very good brand Boat. The best part is that, this product comes with a warranty of 1 year. This is my 2nd piece I have bought. The earlier one I had bought the same product which worn-out  by 11 months of use. So I reached out to the authorized service center and got it replaced without any hassle in 2 minutes. The authorized service center of this brand is also easily accessible. The price tag is affordable for a such too good quality. I strongly recommend this product to others.

Just now I received the earphones; on comparing the  earlier earphones, got from celebrated manufacturersof known mobiles, the sound both bass and treble is outstanding.

Extremely good sound qualityExcellent build and designCheap remote qualityBoat is known for offering great value for money with its products – the Boat Driver in-ear headphones are no different. The three drivers produce impressive sound quality with deep bass that is hard to find in any other earphone.Boat also bundles three sets of ear tips, thus ensuring a comfortable fit for all. The only concern could be the quality of the remote, but the sound and the rest of the build is excellent.If you are looking for a basic pair of wireless earphones that get out of your way and deliver a good sound experience without too much fuss, the Boat could be a good option.

Really really really worse product. I used it for just 1 month and then it stopped working. Never buy this product. Really sophisticated wire.If bought must be handled with great care and not suitable for daily use.It's sound quality is good but could be better.Talking about noise cancellation is way better than it's sound quality.Now about the bass quality, it's just worse than ever.

I bought these especially because most earphones are too big for my ears .. even the wireless boat basshead don't fit me.. these fit me nicely and don't hurt my ears even when I am lying down on one side. I am not a very good judge of audio quality but these are very good for everyday things phone calls, online classes, and watching Netflix. Wire quality is good. been using it for over three months and no issue so far.
"

Using since two months, I admire the sound quality and the wires are still intact well even I stretch them a lot. The only thing is the poor noise cancellation feature. Whenever I talk to someone in traffic with earphones on, the other end gets a lot of surrounding noises. The same goes with voice recording on Whatsapp, very poor voice message recording. I'm not satisfied with the product quality and for the first time, I bought BOAT earphones. Next time, I'll try JBL for sure. For best sound quality, I'm giving 5 stars otherwise people will get the same sound quality in chinese earphones too.

Material Quality is Good Enough. The Sound Quality is what I bought this for. And it delivers well. Using it for playing Pubg. Quite impressive sound quality. Bass is also superb for that EDM, Trance songs. Only Negative thing is that packaging was shabby I'm adding a picture of it. But the earphones at this rate are OP.After 4 months when the sound could be heard only through left ear. So it broke eventually just after 4 months. So I was unhappy and since it was due to some loose contact I cut through it and it felt like the material wasn't of right order. Meaning the internal wires weren't where it should be. This different lot is sold for cheaper prices may be.

Boat Bassheads 100 is among the most affordable pairs of earphones you can buy from a well-known brand today. This entry-level option is as simple as it gets, but it includes features like an in-line remote and microphone that most users expect from their earphones.Indeed, the Boat Bassheads 100 is simple, ordinary, and functional; you get plastic casings and ordinary rubber-coated cables, but at least you do get a single-button remote and a microphone for voice calls on the Y-splitter.

I m giving my honest review after 3-4 months of usageSo about the headphone it is very good at this price and sound quality, bass is perfect. It is very light wieghted and fits perfectly. But its noise cancellation is not that good so if you want a good noise cancellation earphones you should go for other earphones.Now after using the headphones for 2 months one side of the headphone stopped working so i filed a complaint in the boat customer service it was very easy. They contacted me via email and sms and in 2-3 weeks i got my new pair of headphones. So the customer service is too good.I think at this price u should buy this heaphone👍

i love boat earphone. Sound quality is awesome, one day i use this earphone 8 hrs continuously, then feels little unusual but if you use local earphone of 50 rs. the i definitely say that you can't use after 1-2hrs.Little hole or small cut is appeared in earphone wire and a bit oils from holes i dont know what is this liquid, sound quality remains unchanged.Tip: Please purchase without rubber wire of boat earphone.

Mic button not working after 01 month of purchase. Product registered with boat for warranty. Item was picked up by courier after 01 month. 45 days has lapsed after pick up but repaired item not received till date. Status is also not updated.

Quality of material has dropped down, I could say because I have two bass heads 100 one was bought in 2019 and another one in 2020 which is not good. If material is changed then it should be better. Very cheap wires are used in the 2020 one, it was better than I have from 2019 one. Not sure if I have a genuine or original product in 2020. Beware!! Go for Sony or JBL or highers.

Its just any ordinary headphone. No super bass or bass at all. I was bit skeptical while ordering though some of the reviews were boasting of good bass. Either they haven't felt bass till now or they are just fake reviewers.Wire quality is good and the looks are good too. High frequency and mid frequency sounds are reproduced well. Not good if you are looking for any kind of bass.

Got these on a whim because my old jbl ones were broken. I didn’t expect much, but reviews were nice and the discount meant they were very very cheap.I think they have better sound quality than my A**le,  B*s*, S**y and J** earphones. I assume they will break sooner but that’s the case with A**le too- which break before four months are up so I can’t say I mind. especially for the price offered.I wonder if more expensive versions are even better but for now I’m very happy with what I have.

Over the expectations, boAt bassheads 100,1. Sound quality GOOD (10/10)2. You don't need any equaliser, just plug it in and play. Turn off all your equalisers for the pure sound. (Your songs quality also matter)3. Price GOOD (10/10)4. Looks & style - 7/10, because thy feel very delicate, if you pull it strongly, the earbuds may come off because thy have little no space other than the buds themselves. So handle with care. The one year warranty covers, internal damage, only, without water damage*.Overall 9.9/10

This headphone is good. I will not say great like Senheiser because you have to up your volume a bit to hear clearly. Whereas in Senheiser headphone you can hear perfectly at a much lower volume. But the packaging is good and they are providing extra earbuds. 1 year of warranty is also provided with this product. I cannot say about longevity at this moment because I am only using it for one month. But the main attraction is it is available in various colours and the pink one is good. Also it is coming at a low price of 379.

I don't understand how Amazon can be this careless. I ordered boat earphones, after receiving product when I opened packet , I saw that the box of earphones is damaged and old. Earphones were not working properly, bass was not good mic was broken. I called coustomer care and told them about this and asked for replacement. After few days when I got the replacement package if was worse than before . The replacement earphones box was in good shape but the inside product ""earphones"" were broken, only one side was working. I don't think I am going to use Amazon after this again. They delivered broken product twice.

Its been around a month I am using these earphones. Initially it eorked fine. But after few days, Earphone gets disconnected automatically from phone which is very very annoying. First I thought, its just coincidence or there must be problem with my phone's headphone jack. But now I am damn sure it's the earphone which are malfunctioning. You have to wish to God to be it connected properly untill you complete your music list or movie. microphone is pathetic. Person on the other side do not get voice properly. Not Recommended at all.

It's from boat I used it more than 1 year I ordered it from Amazon 1 year ago .I liked the hawk design it's one of the best design I have ever experienced in an earphones it's very light weight.The bass and the noise cancellation is the best .If you just plug it in in your ear without listening music it won't allow any noise get into your ear .But boat products work nearly 1 year or 1 year few days

The product is really good for the price that it's offered at when compared to other companies earphones like JBL. I have used JBL as well and lost 3 of them. Out of my guilt I stumbled upon a cheaper option which I didn't know would be a better purchase and save me like 200 bucks.

I'm writing this review after more than 2 months of use.I have got this for 349₹. Around this price range, this one's best in the market! Don't go for MI which is same as this price range, I checked that with my friend's, the bass & sound quality is far better with this one.Sound quality is nice! 5/5Noise cancellation is good. 4/5But, as it's mentioned as deep bass... it's not deep bass.. okay, but not bad either.. 80% out of 100% bass.But, if you have Dolby Atmos in your phone, this earphone is awesome!!Cons -* not Fully deep bass.*  cords' are very small (but perfectly fits in ear, not a big issue though)*  Not L shape (already mentioned).* the hollow part(attached to the cord itself)  which drives wire into cord are of fragile... don't know when it breaks.... it's main issue for me. Need to be careful while inserting cords into ear & removing from ear.Overall, it's the best WITHIN 400₹ in the present market!

It's a right choice to go .. I am saying you in s summarising manner that it truly has 12 months warranty .

I used my warranty card and email their support service for DOOR TO DOOR REPLACEMENT . Guys no  one gives door to door replacement ....

Sound Quality: Precisely balanced.  -Bass: is better and above average you gonna enjoy every beat of music  -Mids: are perfectly balanced. I am watching movies all time wearing this headphone.  -Treble: precisely noted. I would say best.Noise Cancellation:  -If you wear it and don't listen to music, about 70% noise you will hear.  -If you listen on midvolume about 30% you will hear  -If at high volume the world is mute.Comfort  -Coming to comfort, look i am writing this review at 60:01Pm 17-06-2020 yes during lockdown. Since Jan 2018  I am using it. From starting lockdown i am spending all time on laptop watching movies at most i have  watched 100+ movies all the time in this earphone and never i say never i had any issue in comfort. It is so  comfortable that it doesnt let you feel that you have wore headphone. For Comfort Level i'll give it 100/100.Finally: If you are looking for low budget headphone and are seriously confused. Beleive at me just forget  everything and blindly i say complete blindly buy it.  Thanks!

My favourite for earphones. Bought it over a month ago and it's held up pretty well - usually for earphones this price, they start going back in a week or so. The audio is still crisp and the bass lives up to the hype. If you're looking for really budget earphones for an assured quality, I say go for it. Also the bird pattern is classy and unique! It came with an assortment of bud types as well. No complaints with packaging either.

I was using the jbl infinity ones before this for about one and a half years - I'd say I have good maintenance habits but I lost those and thought to try boat for once. This was an Amazon choice product when I brought it.Quite disappointed I'd say, even with the warranty since the service center is 22km away and if I have to visit the service center every month or so, its a waste.0/10. Wouldn't recommend it.

I had previously ordered a pair of these earphone and they don't sound good too they suck don't buy them also they last only a month and later one of the ear phone stops working. It's almost impossible to get a warrenty claim on them too.

Best clarity, beat and bass, be it at high volumes or low. You won't find such quality earphones at this price range. To check the quality of your music devices, I would suggest that you can play any AR Rahman song on it and feel the difference yourself.

The quality of Sound  is patheticThe noise cancellation feature is not present.Bass Quality is just ok.Started hurting my ears within the very first hour of usage.Fitment into the ear is not perfectDoesn't support the *Siri*  feature ( not a good match for MAC & iPhone user)

This product is far away from providing clear bass which I get from other product of same price. The sound it produces has more treble effects and looses depth. The made is such that it starts aching ears even wearing it for 20-30 mins. Noise cancellation quality is just OK not more than that. Overall it is not quality productMic needs to be infront on the mouth to let other person hear my voice

Hi Friends,So far I have used n numbers of earphones whose avg cost is 2K+ (all of those are award-winning in their categories).I got it @ 350 , so thought let's try it out. And believe me, it has blown my mind and ears. Its sound is really great.I am writing this reviews to especially college goers, because I know we generally face cash crunch during that period. No need to burn your hard cash for expensive earphones. Blindly go for it.About overall sound quality + bass + beats,9/10 compare to 2K+ award-winning headsets.

Not bad at the offer price but for me overall it was less then expected.less bass as compare to basshead225 this is the most disappointing part.and one more thing to tell i have used 2 baot basshead225 they both get disfunction on side within a year this is again one disappointment if not i like boat product as compare to other product at the price range.now i got basshead100. lets see how far it goes

The product is good and reasonable at this price. The sound quality is good when compared to other products in this price range. If you are a bass lover and wanted at less price, then go for it. Bass is awesome. Noise cancellation is not up to mark. The build type is plastic, could be better if metal is used.

Nice product, using this since 1.5 yrs and it's still going good. Ordered this again for my grandfather. This time the extra buds didn't come with the pack which was dissapointing but as we already had 3 pairs of extra buds at home, we didn't go for an exchange. Else, the quality of product is really good and I would always recommend this

I was apprehensive but went ahead and bought. They sounded okay and the issue started after 5 months.First left earphone started dostorting and soon right distorted as well.Called boats for replacement and they assured it will be replaced against warranty.Now I am waiting for the replacement product for morethan 25 days.. no update from boats.Product reliability is doubtful.

Have been using it since 1 month now. This is a must have in our daily life. Sound quality is too good to be true. Bass quality is awesome. Overall, its a beautiful experience to use it. It has fancy design and is available in all colors. It also gives you extra pairs and comes with a pouch.

Really worth the Money. It came with a black pouch (free) and also a cable to bind the earphones which is cool. The packing was also tight and great.

This is the best earphones in this price segment. Here's the overview:1. Sound Quality: The sound output from this earphone is just awesome. The bass is boosted and audio is crisp and clear.2. Length: The length of the wire is well enough for normal use.3. Looks: The Hawk design on the earbuds looks very good and fits well into the ear.4. Mic: Built in mic is there which works very well. And a physical button is provided for music controls.Overall the built quality is good and a nice audio experience for both amateurs and music lovers.

First of all i am writing the review after a month of usage.The earphones are awesome , but at the other side of also have some cons , so let's talk about it.BOX CONTENTS -You get the earphones in the box , a carrying pouch, two extra pairs of earbuds , a warranty card and a boat pamplet .Quality -The wire quality is good , but near the drivers the wire is little thin . I think you should use it carefully not roughly .Features -You get nothing extra .It's a normal earphone it have a controller to reject,answer calls and to play pause music.Mic -It's pretty decent mic , if you think you can make YouTube videos from the mic you are wrong , it's only for calls. DRIVERS (the part which you insert in your ears) -The drivers fit in your ears so that you cannot hear the outer noise . Bass is very high, sound is crisp and clear.DESIGN - the product have a hawk design which appears big in the photos but it is not that much big.The body is made up of plastic which seems durable but they can make it metal design . It have a 3.5 mm jack which is not gold plated.PROS & CONSPros -Stylish designHigh bassExcellent sound qualityCons -Wire is too thinPlastic body not metalResult -You should buy it with your eyes closed.The boat branding gives you a trust.Definitely go for it...😁😁😁

This product is not original.However for the price of RS.350 it's working good.When I wear this for few hours I slightly feel pain in my ear because of the earbuds maybe.Other than that the sound quality is fine and too bad.If you're looking for a cheap earphones with fairly decent doing quality ,you can buy this.Also I would like to mention about the colour which is not the classy red as shown in the pic but the usual bright red which I'm not satisfied with.

Better than Bassheads 225This provides the best sound quality, a good resolution sound.The highs and low are good, though it lacks a little bass but hey its priced at 399 (349 in deals )I've used various earphones (wired) I prefer wired.I've used Sennheiser CX-275 S, Sennheiser 213, CX 180 Street II

These earphones are really good. I have being using these for more than a year now and they are still working as good as new. I must say these are best earphones available at this rate. Durability is very good. I had been using expensive earphones of JBL and other popular brands but they are not at all durable. They stop working within 3-4 months and you have run to the service center again and again to get it exchanged. So if you are looking for earphones that is durable then you should go for these. Definitely value for the price that you will pay.
"

Decent. Sound Comparable to roadside cheap ones but build quality far better than them. Treble and bass is good but it lacks clarity. Expected at this price range.Only thing bad is that passive noise isolation is terrible. Even at max volume i can hear outside sounds. None of the given eartips make a decent seal.I would suggest getting something else if you are willing to afford, otherwise these make do just fine. For calling purpose its decent.

Although the earphones themselves are great, the tie that's provided (to hold excess part of the wire, preventing tangles) is made of full velcro on the outside and is soft cottony on the other. The problem with this is that when this tie is put into the pouch that comes with the earphones is put into the pouch, the velcro sticks to the pouch and is difficult to take out. I currently solve this problem by flipping the tie, keeping the velcro on the inside with the soft cotton sticking up outside. But a more sustainable and aesthetic design choices might need to be taken.boAt has come a long way though :)

I don't usually write reviews until the product is exceptionally well.I don't have much technical expertise over the sound quality though I can just comment that the sound quality is good.The most remarkable thing about the product I feel is the brilliant service that they provide in terms of complying with what they have promised. Generally companies would provide you with a warranty and then it would be too difficult to avail that warranty (service station located in a different city, service centre denying replacement etc.).One of the sides of earphone stopped working. I filed for a replacement on Dec 4, next day product was picked up from my location and today I have received the replacement of the product. I am so happy about this purchase and would suggest you to avail there services as they seem to be the one honouring their commitments.

Loved this earphone from Boat, everything is good in this earphone in this price range, and the goood thing is that it's so comfy and fits well in ears, and it also comes with different different sizes of earbuds, so you can replace the earbuds with perfect sized earbuds according to ear size.The bass and sound quality is so good you won't be disappointed, I would recommend anyone to buy this piece it comes with one year warranty if face any difficulty in given warranty period you can always raise a concern with boat the will definitely give you best service even I replaced my earphones after 6 months and got a new one, as one side of earphone was not working properly. Considering all the things I can it's best product

I received this item today & I have purchased it by ₹349/-. I got my expected headphone it's great in this price. It fix well into the ear.

During music listening I understood that the bass & sound quality is good. Thank you Amazon and thankful to boAt.

The sound quality is good between low to slightly over mid volume level but it gets somewhat distorted when listening in full volume. It's not a big issue the sound output of the headphones is quite loud. The bass is quite decent as well.The earpods get more comfortable with use and they are a perfect fit. They doesn't seem to come out of my ears as some reviewers have mentioned.The plastic quality is justifiable for the price.Sometimes, my phone doesn't detect the headphones' mic in which case I have to unplug and replug the headphones. This can be quite annoying. Anyway, I think it is an individual issue (my bad luck).Overall, it is a decent pair of headphones that you can get for ₹399.

As the name suggests if you are a bass head then this one is for you, it's cheap but has some good bass on it the sound quality may not be the clearest but as it is a bass focused earphones it's justified and getting it at ₹350 is a good deal the build quality is average but it's a very low price so no complaints there too..Overall if you're looking for earphones in which you can feel the bass for a low price then this is the one for you but if you have a budget of 2k and are looking for a bass focused earphones I will definitely suggest Sony extra bass earphones those are really awesome.

I'm writing this review after using 10 months and now it got damaged. Left side speaker is not working. I've seen other few reviews and found most of the cases, this headphone is used to get damaged after 10-12 months of use in average. Here are some pros & cons:Pros:1. Good sound & bass.2. Provided an stickable band to prevent chaos of wires 😁.3. Good wire length.Cons.1. May get damaged (one speaker will not work) after 10-12 months of use.2. Low class technology is used in binding wires inside the mic. portion which may cause wire damage.Bought this at Rs.349 from Apporio Retail.

Product is really very good. Boat's products are always awasome. Bass is very good and not overpowering the music. There are two pairs of extra ear phone buds which are very important.

I've tried over many headphones and earphones from different price ranges till now, and for this price range, these Boat Earphones were not as I expected.

Good design and functionality. But the product didn't last the warranty period. It's made of poor quality material.

Not recommended!

Hi, I have received my product yesterday thanks to Amazon prime delivery.So here is my review,  I may be biased as I just broken sennheiser cx 180 earphone and it was one of the best phone.So since I was very careless user hence I chose to buy some cheaper but good product and voila here I found this.This earphone is average-1- Looks  strong2- Bass - Flat3- Packing - Nice4- Use - not good fit for your ears, will come out even with light touch on the wire5- Others- extra 2 buds with packs6- Output - Clear but low/average soundOverall it just a normal average earphone and if you dont want to spend 800 + this could be your choice just to make calls and not to listen music :(

I ordered these to play PUB-G and from Day 1 I knew the sound quality isn't impressive at all. The sound rips as in breaks with metallic impressions.

The sound quality is not that great to be honest.

To start with, the earphone is good for starters . For someone who is an audiophile, they will be left wanting for more.the bass is hollow , treble is not very well defined. This is in comparison to the senheiser CX 180. Or other similar ones. Durability needs to be validated over time. Good buy to start with.

It took 3-4 days to warm up (like the sound got better after continuous playing for long hours). So when you get the product bear with the sharp flat sound for a few days it gets tuned up within 3days then you can judge on it.Noise cancellation is bad....very bad but i just wanted good audio so it's worked the best for me. At first i also thought that its sound quality is too cheap for the brand name but after 3days i got to hear what I'd expected. Glad that i didn't return it the very first day.

Budget Superhero! Loud, bass full & Clear Enough to make you feel that your music is being played in a studio.Earphones which came with my 6s started giving me problems after 1 year of usage. Right pod happen to serve dim voice. To be specific, I play PUBG more often and very few earphones are compatible with this game in terms of in game sound which enables a user to be more responsive throughOut his/her gameplay. Special note - put your phone’s EQ on bass reducer for even better response during your gameplay.Music is my drug and but I’m more leaned towards gaming. Rest assured every song you gonna play on it is gonna make you move!Hope this helps.

The number given in that card can never be connected, and no other way to get it replaced or repaired by the company..

Apart from brand name nothing fancy. Sound quality is below average and the product looks fancy(red) namaste but I doubt how long it will last since built quality is terrible. 50rs headphones better in terms of value for money since I didn't found any difference in sound quality.

It's a good product but the only thing I was not satisfied with was its design. Well the earphones makes it uncomfortable for you to sleep and listen to music as it's pointed(the design) so you cannot really sleep on one side for a long time. Otherwise everything is good but it should have been little less pointed beside keeping the real design.

Okay this is pretty basic model of the boat i guess.I ve been using this for 2 months now,didnt find any prob.Actually this earphone focuses more on treble rather than bass which made it pretty basic.Noise canceling is poor ! Not at all good !Mic is okayish ! Can be used for petty basic purposes!The reason why i took this is because of their service and product quality.In my case..im okayish with this still they could have made the noise canceling more better and also the bass.

I suggest if you can shell out rs.150 more and buy boat225 instead. This earphone is average and boat has better collection in this category.

Nothing cons to mention.Shipping: Received in time, product came in just the way i could have bought it from a showroom. No defects scratches or anything such.Product: Plugged in to test over different genres and could say that bass & treble are adequate. Only if the volume goes above 90% you will feel treble more and less of bass.Plug it tight so to enjoy the flavour of music. No heating up as i played continuously for over an hour.Sound quality is good its not at all annoying.Ofcourse I cannot say it the best ONLY when compared with those of higher priced headsets above 3k+ give best variation of sound quality that you tap your feet upon every type of genre.Price: Bought it at 379/- and the features provided are all worth for this price.Inbox: 2 pairs of additional ear buds and a small cute mesh to wrap the earphones neatly.I have rated it 5 based on the features and additional thngs provided at such a reasonable cost.

After using for 1 month, I can say I bought this for meetings as I have lot of meetings in day. I liked the wired one because you can unplug from laptop, plug into mobile and continue your meeting. No need to have extra pair of earphones. Also, no need to join wireless earphone via bluetooth ass it will take lot of time. I pretty much enjoy these earphones. Although I  have costlier ones as well. but those are big and are not so portable.The only problem you will face with these wired earphones when you are making tea/coffee but still want to see what's being shared by teammate on MS-teams or any other meeting app which can be little frustrating because wired earphones are not suitable in that case.i will rate 3.5 out of 5.

The product boAt Bassheads 100 are absolutely terrible set of earphones! The quality otherwise seems okay kind, but whenever I try to speak to someone, the person on the other end complains of getting to hear their own voice. It's kind of useless piece of device for me! Wouldn't recommend it to anybody...it's a waste of money! HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!!

This is good product which i got after discount in Rs.650. It is worth for this price but not actual price. Sound quality is good as well as bass quality too but not up to the mark as if you have ever used JBL earphone even below this price offers great sound and bass quality. Noise cancellation is also not up to the mark if you compare with JBL earphone.Over all lookwise it is awesome with stylish outer design as well as in sound quality if you compare with other normal products.

These earphones are really good. Appreciate he product quality and would recommend it.If you are person who places earphones irresponsibly, these are the best fit. They do not tangle so much. And get easily entangled. Unlike other earphones, the sound quality and mic quality doesn't degrade with time, it's still working in its full efficiency even after 1 year. Have bought it again for ky family members as well.Low cost and high efficiency. One of the finest earphones available.

Hi, friends..first and most important point to be noted is that whenever you buy earphones..you should clean it with tissue or soft cloth after every use and cover it properly for longer durability...BoAt wired earphones has super extra bass, it has an inbuilt mic, it's hawk's design is very nice, it is available in FOUR colours black,white,furious red and taffy pink, I bought white colour  for my kid. It's give you one year warranty as well as its repair and replacement process is hassle free and easy, but I personally think u don't need repair or replacement if u use them properly....Thank you...

The main highlights what I like are:1. The Boat Bassheads 100 is very affordable.2. The headset comes in a variety of colours3. Sound quality is decent enough for the price.Although plastic, the casings do look nice thanks to their unique design.Don't let the price of the Boat Bassheads 100 have you think you're getting a sub-par product; this pair of earphones does a decent job. The sound is loud, and the sonic signature suits most popular music genres with slightly elevated responses in the lows and highs. With the volume low, the sound was devoid of any excitement, but pumping the level up to around 80 percent immediately improved sound quality.
"

Just after one month its left earphone stopped working, and the reality is boAt didn't respond even it's under warranty period. So, basically it is like a Chinese product. If you got a good one it's your luck, if not, you can't do anything except writing them continuously.

Order in black.Got in White Color.It's been a month right side, not proper working.For a period of time, it works fine.Edit:- It been 2 months, not working properly.P.S- The warranty service takes at least 1 month to replace the product. Till then you can enjoy the real voice or find new products.Namaste 🙏

Been a user of boat earphones since 2016, used almost all budget earphones of boat 180 bass heads, 225 bassheads. But the boat rockers 100 are the best under sub 500 Rs. price.The personal experience with boat rockers 100.I have been using boat rockers 100 from 20 months and the experience has been amazing! The bass gets better and better over time. For better experience try playing burn in videos for 1-2 days and the improvement will be there.It's the go to choice under 399/-

 Dislike:1) Makes a woosh woosh noise due to the dangling cable.2) Poch is useless because it doesn't protect the device from dust and water. Or damage from keeping it in pocket when not in use.3) Velcro strap or cable organizer is another irritating because it sticks to cloth. It sticks to the pouch while putting the headphone in or taking out from the pouch.4) Having the pouch or not are same.

Most of this earphone’s design and feel is good but the overall sounds are bit treble side. there is a little kirky trebling trailing every sound which cant be ignored even with a bass predominant audio file. Amplification is quite loud makes isolated experience. in the end price do match with the product because it also comes with a pouch and a velcro strip to keep earphone wires wrapped untangled.

I purchased this as it got good reviews on average 4 stars. But the sound quality is not satisfying. Even a 80 rs headphone will sound a better. The pricing should not exceed 150.

Those who only wants design then the build quality is awesome but dont expect good sound.

It came with a sticker that was very stylish and it was good quality. The shape of the phone that we put in our ears is like scally as it is in the photo and it's the new trend to have unique earphones and it came with a mini warranty card which half the size of our little finger. It also has a mini bag to keep the earphones tidy and also some soft things that protect our ears from pain in a little zip-lock bag and I really recommend it.

First, there is no bass at low volumes. At high volumes it is just ok but very less bass. Quality is very good. Extra ear plugs included. Comes with warranty card and you can register your product on their website. For 399 quality is very nice but it is not for bass lovers. There is no bass, forget extra bass as advertised on the product page. Amazon delivery is excellent as usual.

Hello guys, this boat earphone are great. May be we cannot compare it with Jbl or Sony , at this price it is the only beast.Other earphones at these price is not good.The bass is good treble is average and noise cancellation is good. It's bang for your bucks.Go for it if you need an entry level earphones. If you looking for pure sound experience you can go for Sony or Jbl , but it cost double the cost of this earphone. So if you need a good quality earphone at lower price this product is for you

These are decent earphones in this price range (300-400) but add a few more hundred and you have more durable earphones with much better sound quality. The sound quality is above average, bass is ok (I'm comparing this to JBL and another one of BoAt's headphones which were of superior bass output), nose cancellation is good. But I would really fault these earphones for not being durable because they've stopped working within a few months of usage.The replacement process is really good and their customer service is good too. I think it took 2 weeks to get my replacement earphones.I would buy these if I couldn't afford better (which is what I did initially :D)

The headphone comes with 3 sets of earbuds and it covers the noise. But the mike is very average, as we have to keep it near the mouth all the time while talking.

Just bought it over Amazon after seeing so many positive reviews and the affordability of it. Just gave it a try and I must admit that It's one of the best headphone out in the market. I mean being a continuous user of ""Sony MDR-XB30EX"" since last 4 years, I was little hesitant about the sound quality of ""boAt BassHeads 100"" before buying. But i think i've made a great choice. Sound quality is almost identical to aforesaid Sony device and the price difference is almost Rs. 1500. Isn't it a fair deal ?Now the best part-1. Deep bass2. Balanced treble3. Impressive sound clarity4. Rubber made5. Comfortable earbudsAnd all of these comes with a one year of warranty. I mean what else could you expect in just Rs. 400 ? Just go for it guys..

The sound quality is pretty good for headphones in this price range, but I would have liked better quality plastic. The mic box and button plastic is a little flimsy. Also the aux jack is straight not an L, so the wire is more prone to breaking. The whole set is quite bulky.To be honest I've bought JBLs in the same price range and found them better, but just a sugestion.

I would just say these headphones are awesome. Crisp audio quality and superb base which required and adjusted according to individual song.10/10I believe this same quality you might get in branded or higher range headphones.This is real competitive company to others.I tested just 15 mins on my Samsung J2 (basic phone), my iPad mini, Xiaomi Note 7 and Note 6 pro.All were having throughput awesome.Go for it guys..350/- is definitely more than worth buying.

"

Very good for music and normal work but I wouldn't recommend them for gaming as the treble levels are high and for getting bass you will have to push them inside your ears which is only possible if you keep holding them with your fingers. I played rainbow six siege on my xbox using these and the audio of shotgun shots were so without bass, so i wouldn't recommend them for gaming but if you dont have much budget these can do the job. The bass quality while listening to music is great, changed some equaliser settings in Spotify and got the best bass and treble.

It is an entry level product and as that it is very good As entry level product of Boat it lives up to the expectation. I was not looking for anything exotic. This one is for use with a mobile.

It is what it costs. Good design decent sound. Above than average headphone. If you have good phone with equalizer setting, it can be set to best sound output.

The earphone, was just kept without any packing in boat paper box  below another heavy weight order(a plastic table). From day 1 the earphone had issues: once plugged to cellphone,, had to shake the wire back and forth to be able to hear anything. Within a week, from purchase date, the copper wire came out of black rubber sheeth. Headphone are now dead, not working at all after 7 days post delivered.The INR 400 Rs. on earphone are totally wasted, disappointing experience with product and/or packaging, first time on Amazon.

Ok for the price it's quite a steal. I just wanted a regular headphone for basic utility like some multimedia streaming and a few calls and for that it's more than you would need .However if you want an immersive music experience.for long hours I would definitely not suggest this as they are not very comfortable for extended hours of usage (more than 1 hr or so). Otherwise a great pair of earphones .The only con that I have is that the bass is a little over the top ,and this is a very preferential thing to say but I find that no body would listen to any song with that much amount of bass in it ,but hey that's just me .And 1 more thing why in the world did you have to make the back of the eartip so damn sharp, I mean at times it hurts just while putting  it in your ears. But that's just a design thing I would say . I have been using it for a couple of months now  and I have been very satisfied with the product .I would recommend this only if you want a basic headset for your day to day use and for that it is a great bang for the buck.But if you want a pure music experience then I would say that you have better products in the market.

I'm NOT SATISFIED with the purchase... Don't get me wrong, the sound quality is amazing for a earphone this cheap, but its flat... The bass kicks in only when there's too much bass in the music, else the sound feels very flat... Also the audio via the microphone is bad, and the mic is located on the split end of the cable, which is very low... At times I've heard people complaining that they cannot hear my voice clearly... Only for those who are struck with the price tag of 300-400rs... In that range its good, but if you can spend a 100rs more, get the basshead 225...

Sound quality is very poor. If your previous earphone had decent sound then you will be very disappointed with this. The sound is too metallic and not rich.Also, it is not comfortable to wear.

Bought it for my wife as she is not so much of a gadget lover. The overall sound quality is okay, but the bass is too low. As per the name ""bassheads,"" it must atleast deliver a decent amount of bass. The build quality and looks are good. It also fits well in the ear.

It does give a lovely sound quality and I was pleasantly surprised with the bass. Weak noise cancellation. Mic isn't THAT good as it claims to be. The long wires which I like, however, feel plasticky and flimsy for rough usage.I received a defective pair(issues with mic) at first so I got it exchanged. Expected more but can't say I'm disappointed at this price. I needed a good mic though. Go for it if you just want a cheap pair with a good sound quality and quite some bass!

Bought this seeing the huge no. of 5 star reviews, but I doubt the authenticity of these reviews now, for these earphones are nothing more than average performers. The sound is so low even at max volume that it's practically impossible to make out what the other person is saying when on call.

Well for 300rs you can't expect much. I was surprised to see that they provide a carrying pouch, 2pairs of extra earbuds and a 1year warranty for such price.The sound is pretty flat and virtually negligible instrument separation (well, that cannot be expected at such price point). Does the job for minor audio tasks like video call, yt video, etc. Won't really recommend for listening to music.

The highly not recommended product and brand also. The earphones was working good for 2 months and after that one side of the earphones stopped working unexpectedly. The customer service from the brand is worst than the product. No response from their side after 10-12 complaint mails.

Totally worth it, the wire rubber gets weared out first because it's not so good in quality but i guess at this price I shouldn't be complaining.Verdict:- if on a budget and looking for something reliable and long lasting, which doesn't end up with 1 earpiece not working, this is the one to go for!

If you consider it's price (₹ 349), it's worth it.In my case my left earbud stopped working after 7 months.. and after placing the replacement request in the boat portal..I got the replaced earphones after 1 month. It takes approximately 1 month for the replacement process. And approximately after 3 months, the left earbud of replaced earphones also stopped working.So, honestly, these earphones are durable obviously and worth the price.

Amzon is becoming platform of cheatera everyday.I bought this earphone 1 side earphone is not working.focus on quality of products otherwise u will loose your cuatomers.I have placed placement of this item. Let's what i will get in return a working one or the same defected piece. Atleast focus on customer complaints. And check what the sellers are sending to customers.

First of all, kudos to Amazon. Ordered at 11.55PM and got the delivery 1:00PM next day. Great deliveryVery nice headphones with Mic in this price range. That too with 1 year warranty.Sound quality could have been better but can't complainBass and Noise cancellation is awesomeOverall a great buy.

This thing is gud for bass lovers. Also enjoyable for action movies.but hold on a moment, this product afer using a few minutes, my ears are so paining and i feel heavy. Because of those earbuds. Change to smaller ones so that it will comfort u. Also sound quality i say is gud actually but it can be more gud . So this is it. Its your choice to buy this or not. I prefer headphones instead of these because they do not hurt ears. Also give a entire different surround effect.

Very average headphones. Bass quality is poor. Sound is average. Noise cancellation is so bad you cannot use it while you are outdoors. Only if you put the volume up to maximum will you hear the music clearly. You will get better headphones even at a cheaper price than this one. Joke of a headphones made by a brand like Boat! Disappointing!

Guys guys... Here is n my review for boats headphones , i got it from a sale at₹399 the box was simple packaging and we also get a warranty card... Coming to the build it's of rubber and plastic for the earplugs ... Which is not a great build ... Then work with the sound is mind blowing ... Damn loud at full volume ... And the mic quality is good and button feels tactile and handy when in use... The wire is long and the earbuds don't fall off from ear easily ❤️🔥 it is a must buy guys ❤️👍🏻

The velcro sticks with the case provided. Even if you manage to put the earphones (wrapped with Velcro) inside the case it's a struggle to take it out.Otherwise Nothing on the Earphones specially at this price range.Great sound qualityNice bassEffective Noise CancellationOnly build can be better.

 The boat earphone is defective the third time ,I unfortunately trusted boat and had bought  earbuds wirless and they work properly but the touch became unresponsive and by that time when the defect started it was late to replace , and now I bought boat 100 mint orange ear phone wired I got the product yesterday it was defteive it was replaced today it is again defective

after 4 months of using, the earphones still do well for a sub 400 category. Sound quality has been good as always, decent bass  gives you good listening experience,you cannot expect higher end audio quality but with this price you are getting a good deal, wires are tangle free, but they are fragile on join like every other wired earphones so you have to be very careful with that. if you keep it nice and clean, don not sleep over it  then it will last long

Overall I would give 4 star. Bass is fine not good as JBL does. As was using JBL first so thought of giving a try for this brand.Still going well from 3 monthsAlso bought same for my mom. She liked it as wellEar don't pain even after you wear it for long time

Everyone in my family has this same headset as the performance is great for such a price range. Also another great feature is the super quick service of Boat, if anything happens inside warranty period. They exchange it within 12 days to dot. Only con - This is purely for bass lovers. Sometimes fine notes and milder sounds is overpowered by the bass.

1st review :Look wise great but design needs improvement. Speaker and volume part is positioned too low to receive your voice, especially in crowded places.Music through these has more bass inclination.2nd review: after 8 months of using it occasionally. One side of the earphone stopped working. Wondering how to claim for warranty now. 😐

Look, if you want best quality earphones, go for it. They're so underrated. And the price is lower than what it should be.They beat jbl earphones.  The 499 ones.They have  quality bass and I'm impressed.Tho the mic quality is not fit for recording purposes but it's okay for calling. The bass is very high and clear sound.  Theres 95% noise cancellation.Go for it, I had ordered pink ones and they look very cute.

I had bought this for my wife. I purchased the T Rebel shade. Its a sort of bluish purple. What i liked most was that it came with a satchel with the string-pull pouch and 3 extra sets of matching ear-cushions. This was not mentioned anywhere in the product details.I must say I was very impressed. It was very thoughtful of the manufacturer / seller !!
"
592,"
Great, probably the best at this price range (under 400). Sound is good, crisp, and deep bass which isn't fake or un-natural.Only issue is with its fitting, we cannot keep them on for a long session as the plastic body before ear bud is huge and it pains. If you want this for small sessions, best in budget, if long sessions is on your mind, look elsewhere

I repurchased it for the 4th time in 3 years (my cats keep destroying them so I have to buy headphone after every 6 months or so) so this is easily my go to headphones within the affordable range. I got it for ₹379 this time.Boat never disappoints with its sound quality. The ear buds are also very comfortable (for extra comfort here's a tip - use the smallest size of ear bud). The best part this time it came with a cute pouch!!!

I will give 4 stars. Its sound quality is amazing for the price which it comes, its just awesome, but when it comes to the microphone and its noise reduction, its pathetic. Even when I am in my room and attending calls, I have to get the microphone near my mouth or else I am not properly audible. Generally the earphones I have used have better microphones than my phone, but this is like a stepback from the mic of my phone!If you are buying for sound quality, go for it, its amazing, but if you are someone who is purchasing it mainly for calls, then I won't recommend this one.

Got this Earphones, 2 months later the sound started crackling and we can hear our own voice from its mic. Registered a complaint. They set up a pickup for the same on 4th October, 2019.

Good product but it got repair after just 5 months but boat is always there for you they gave 1 year warranty with the product. I am staying in tamilnadu due to this pendamic situation but on my request they shipped my headset from tamilnadu to Mumbai for checking it and they replaced it. For 400 rs product I gave to them they replaced it with a product with a value of 650 rs. I really appreciate the customer service of boat company.

boAt is now my most favourite brand for purchasing any audio device. I have bought Stone 200 and Stone grenade previously.Talking about this Mid-Range InEar headphone/earphone, this is fabulous.Design and Build Quality: No Gold Plated audio jack (no one cares of it) but the jack is covered with soft rubber which may give that joint a better strength. Cord quality is well enough. Has a dedicated mic in it with a single button which works well. Now the earbuds have such an ergonomic design that will feel you good and has rubber joint over there as well. So it will make it stronger. So overall it is strong enough.Sound Quality: Fabulous!! All 3 ranges are so well that you can put them on for hours without feeling any headache(it is tested by me for 5 hours). Noice cancellation works also very good. You can experience it while playing PUBG or on a call.Gaming Experience: I do play PUBG Mobile using it and overall it is good. Even on its maximum volume, you won't feel them SCREAMY and mic also works well in that. My only problem with it is if you are pushing the audio jack to any direction, you may feel that one of your earbud will stop working. It may be my phone's fault but I'm just telling its just a pin, not a screw which is fixed. So make sure you check your phone if the jack will get interrupted or not while holding your phone.My complaints: Though I clean my ears regularly, the buds gets dirty whenever I use them. So I have to clean them all time when I use them.Edit:Lifespan: Both earpieces lasted for around a year. After some days, one of them stopped working. But it was a very good experience taking its price in account.I will give it 4.5/5 for just those dirty buds issue.

Headphones have a heavy base sound and good treble as per my liking. Its one of the best headphones under the price tag of Rs.400 and below. bOAt provides extra sizes of buds which is a nice along with 1 year of warranty. I can't say about the durability and warranty experience of the product as of now cause I just started using it but overall headphones are nice. Will update the review after 2-3 months of usage.

I have used 6 of them and they impress me everytime.Light to carry around and so elegant looking they are.I would advise people to not use it at the maximum value because it can make you deaf.I am not exaggerating.Must buy it if you look for a nice alternative to bluetooth but don't want to compromise on quality.

Hi Guys,This earphones is good only for first few months. I have bought these earphones 2 times.And everytime the reason was that one side of earphone stops working after 1-2 months. I would suggest you not to buy it because it wont last for more than 2 Months. Buy this earphone if you are okay with listening from one side of earphone. Because its my personal gurantee that one side of earphone will definetly stop functioning after 2 months of use.

This product left me speechless...in the review they are asking me to give it a rating from a scale of  1 to 5....but I think this scale isn't enough to rate my experience with these earphones which was of just 2 mins.Sound quality was so good that I couldn't hear a single thing...and the bass was just bombastic...cause again I couldn't hear a single thing.First these earphones left me speechless and now I think may be I am deaf too.Either these earphones were defective or maybe I am deaf.Too good of a product to be on Amazon.in

I had ordered this wired earphones and it worked well for 1 month,suddenly the left earphone stopped working and in another week right earphone also stopped working.There is no physical damage to in earphones it is an internal issue.

The noise cancellation feature is super effective. Quite durable and economical. Love the colours they come in. Its Just that the beats of the song are clear only if you turn the volume really high, but then the music rings at an even higher pitch in your eardrums, so have to settle for a low volume and compromise on the beats. Over all its satisfactory purchase. If I compare it with my previous JBLs, it lags in the “beats” experience”, but durability, price and colour wise Boat takes the cream of the cake.

Product was working very well for the first 1.5 months, then it started disturbing, whenever I plug in the earphone into my phone, volume changes automatically, sometimes increasing, sometimes decreasing. Videos are getting paused automatically. Did not expect this to happen only after using it for 1.5 months. And now the microphone of the earphone is also damaged. Phone call is not possible through the earphone. The other end cannot hear anything. Expected much better experience. Very much disappointed. Looking for a free replacement by Amazon if possible.

The earphones are working ok but the mic doesn't work. Bought them about a month ago. They're pretty useless without the mic. I don't see an option for return otherwise I would have returned them.

We may nit pick on the features of this product, but I have experience of buying higher end headphones which don't last for more than six months. This product is sturdy, can be fairly good in sound quality (you may not hear the lower sound on Netflix or Amazon Prime especially when the subtitles say ""dogs barking in the distance"".
"

So i brought my earphones in March 2021, and i am a college student. I use them everyday and am rough with them too sometimes. The fact that they endured almost a year is a big feat especially when earphones have a tendency to ruin every 4 to 5 months (6 at max). I like them so much that i am repurchasing them again. Just for the sake of durability and good sound quality. If you are wondering if its worth it, pls go ahead and make the purchase.

This product might seem to be a very good bang for your money kind of product but trust me, do not invest in this product.The product is of very low quality, there is low to no finishing on the product and you won't be able to use the earphones for longer durations.

The product is poor. It’s not even worth the price tag being floated around.

It’s not even worth a punt at this price point. It’s just bad. It’s horrible. Stay far far away.

I bought this product around 1 and half years ago and within a few months it's one side stopped working so claimed a warranty and guess what they took 2 months for repair maybe because of the covid situation but guess what it stopped working again so I claimed a warranty again. This time they gave me a replacement and it has now stopped working again but I can't claim the warranty cause it's over. Overall experience- Disappointed.

I am not even surprised by such an amazing quality earphones. I always had high expectations from boAt and it always delivers. Business as usual.PLightweight, can be used continuosly for long hours- Sound quality is awesome, much better than some earphones priced at 1k- Wire quality is good

I purchased these a year ago and the piece stopped working literally a month after the end of warranty period. Initially one earpiece stopped functioning but I didnt mind & used the other earphone by itself. Within 6 months the other earpiece stopped as well & I couldnt even get it sorted cause my warranty expired.Pros:Good Bass & trebleGood noise cancellationWire is rubber material yet durableConsNot long lasting

I bought it in Dec2018. Product is good. But after 8 months One Ear stop functioning. If such things happen then what is the difference between branded product and local product available @ just Rs 50/-There is one year warranty but there is no adequate guidance given to process the request.Please help.

Looks : i ordered a pair of red color. Looks awesome.Bass: adequate amount of bass. No issues with that as well.Fitting: fits perfectly well into my ear structure.Durability: i would say average, but then again can't expect more than this at this price range.  As long as you're not rappelling with it, you'd be fine.Delivery: delivered on time.Value for money: 5/5

There seems to be some defect in poor quality wire of this earphone. Although it worked fine for 20-25 days, it started malfunctioning after that. The volume itself goes up and down, sometimes even putting phone on silent mode. A very disappointing end of a product of such simple and good design. Hope the company looks into this fault.

Very very very bad product. I bought is 3 months ago and now it has totally stopped working. The sound quality decreases day by day. I filed my problem under it's warranty of 1 year. They collected the product from my place. There isn't any response from their side. I have been waiting for their response since last 20 days. Very bad after buying services. I prefer not to buy these types of products and even don't believe on their warranty policy. They are just fine words to make you buy their products.

The earphones got screwed in 8 months so tried to call in service center they are were not responding even efter 15 to 20 attemps of call got a reply that the product is not in the stock. So i used to call every 2 days in a week and i did this for about a month every time they used to say that company is not sending stocks to us.I wish i can upload the recording of the talks of customer service representative and meNO DOUBT ABOUT SOUND QUALITY THAT IS TOTALLY GREAT BUT SERVICES ARE TOTALLY LIKE ***HELL***ONE THING I CAN GARUNTEE THAT THIS EARPHONES WILL DEFINITELY GET SCREWED BEFORE ITS WARRANTY.

Not bad for the price but for one major exception... The mic quality is bad and it's placement is highly unintuitive. It is near the chest so you will have talk louder or hold it physically near your mouth. If you're walking then it's a major issue. The buds are also not great for for the ears.
"

You might not notice a significant difference between your current earphones and this one, cause probably there's not much tbh (depending on what earphones you are currently using). The sound quality is okay, it's not gonna blow you away of course and there's just enough base to make it work I guess. After listening to a couple of songs (320 Kbps), I can say that I am not disappointed I guess.

I'm really satisfied with the product Amazon has brought to me. The bass quality is great not so wow factor but really good to really enjoy. I have a huge craze to listening to music everyday, every moment in my day. I know listening to muisc really loud is bad but I can't help it. I give so much importance to bass whenever I listen to any type of music so I can grade the bass quality with 8.5/10. The sound quality is also good and so niose cancellation. If you love listening to songs  with extremely good bass, I really recommend you to buy VIVO XE710 and the apple earphones are the best I assure you for bass quality

I've tried alot of earphones which costs more than 600 RS. But when I bought this, I found the quality of sound and bass is amazing. The only thing which makes me giving this 4 stars is the mic quality. It's pretty good compared to others but not very good while recording the sound of PC or Laptop or even a gaming console. Otherwise if you want this only to listen songs, buy it right now. you won't regret it

This is a basic version in the headsets manufactured  by boat. Its a value for money. The only backdrop of this product is that yhe cable gets tangled easily. If you want a headphone which do not gets tangled then you should not buy this. Better go for a different version. Other than that the product is good at delivering good audio.

There are really bad for gaming. I bought them not for the sole purpose of gaming but obviously when you buy ear phone you would use it for everything. For people who play games like pubg, it's a big no no. You wouldn't be able to hear how close or far the footsteps are when you are in a fight. I used to use the Apple earphones and they are the best I have ever used. While playing pubg, the sound that comes originally from the left comes from the right so it's extremely annoying. They keep getting out of my ears too. The only thing it's good for is music and movies. Nothing else. A waste of money for a gamer.

Boat BassHeads comes with a sturdy cable and solid connector. Fits well in laptop, iPad and iPhone.I also bought Sennheiser in-ear wired earphone - unfortunately it failed to fit properly in my iPad and this Boat Bassheads came for rescue. Good performance and sound quality for conversation and light music. The is mild loss of audit quality at a higher volume. Overall a good performer at the price point.

I bought it in January 2019. I have been using it for almost a year. I must say it is durable and easy to carry around. The sound quality is also good. Use it with care you can carry it one more year. But due to my inappropriate use the wire got broken. But still I am using it there is no complaint with hearing. Only a certain part the insulation is gone. Planning to buy a new boat headset for the next year.

It is unbelievably low quality. The sound is pathetic. Worse than 50 rupees roadside head phones. The bass is negligible.

Save your money and order any other brand. Hopeless.

In overall processed time these earphones were only good at bass and other than that the sound but also the noice cancelation were the worst case scenario.And within not finished warranty time the product got lost.

This does not really cancel out all the noise, and there's a bit of an echo. Even the shape is not modern and slips off. My 10-year old iPod earplugs, with ancient round pods, have so much more clarity. But since those did not come with a speaker, and since I bought the Boat ones in a deal for Rs 249, I'm not complaining at all.

Delivered a day before, but was very well.  The Extra earbuds, pouch for carrying, and warranty card is also included. The sound quality is good. Packaging was unopened. Hope so it works very well for at least 2 or 3 years. I conclude, that the product was very nice and as expected. But ya, I have to wear the left side in right ear and right side in left ear so that it fits properly. Or else it comes out of the ear. But otherwise, everything's well..

Writing review after almost 2 weeks after the purchase. Quality of product which boat produces is undoubtedly great externally. Cord in ear headphones are of good built. This product was purchased by me for requirements of good bass. Bit disappointed with the bass. While playing music, soft songs are played beautifully but when it comes to high bass sounds the product loses its rating. @boat should improve the bass quality of this product as in this price many other brands are offering good bass. Noise cancellation works only if the volume is high otherwise it does not work much.
"
699,"
The overall outlook is good but I must say the product is not up to the level. It feels cheap in hands, feels low quality making. The noise cancellation is good but sound quality can only be said as just average (even considering the price). Bass is ok but not as deep as they say. If you're looking for earphones in ₹400 I would suggest to buy another one may be the mi earphones which also I've used and is much better experience. I strongly suggest to seek another options.

Bought this back in November 2020. It was working fine and all of a suddent one side stopped working this past week and I put it on for ""Warranty"" replacement. They delivered a new one real quick, but it's literally a more cheaper version of what i paid for. The wire is too thin, the treble just screeches into my ears and you barely feel any bass.Giving only 2 star as it worked good for a few months only.

This is a very unreliable brand. These earphones stopped working within 2-3 months from the purchase date. I emailed the company as it is still within warranty period but haven't got any response from the company even after a month. I have purchased from boat twice. With a gap of quite a few years in between the two purchases. Both times the earphones (of different price ranges) stopped working in less than 5 months! Buy at your own risk.

Worst earphones, quality is pathetic, Beware before buying this product NON RETURNable, and High Priced.  Even any local shop will have better product than this one.  The Mic is placed at the junction of the 2 ear phone cable splits, this position is vey low for on your mouth(at chest level) resulting in very poor MIC audio.

I bought this earphones in April 2021,it has this braided wire instead general flexible one.I thought braided wire would have more strength but it had already worned out in June.And in the case of return and replacement policy it is only available for 7 days on Amazon but for further warranty benefits to you need to visit their service centers which are rare (atleast in my case nearest service center is 25Km).Sound quality is Good for this price range but Built quality is worst.

You cant expect much from an earphone at this price point. Its an earphone, and it works.

I have been using this product for about a month now, and I have to say, The earphones are the best you could get for this price-point. The quality of sound was crisp, the bass was sufficient, not too overbearing yet not very mellow either, and the noise cancellation was extraordinary as well. Even being near a Loudspeaker, almost none of the external sound was audible when the volume for these was full. The build quality could have been a little better, I guess but what else can you ask for this price right?Needless to say, I am completely and utterly satisfied with my experience.

Some of these 300-400 range earphones were the worse you can get. But these are light , comfortable and have the best sound quality from the competition ( as far as i know comment me some suggestions if you have tried something better in this range ).

It's noise cancelling but it itself makes so much noise. If it rubs against your shirt, it makes this irritating rubbing noise that ruins your music experience.

I bought these Earphones on the 22nd of June 2020 , and on the 3rd of July I started encountering the problem of Imbalanced sound. The Earphones were under the warranty Period of 1 year , so I tried to approach the Company for Warranty claims But no one is answering. Really bad experience.

Based on my past experience, I selected this ear phone again. But I was proved wrong this time. This stopped working first when I was using it in my phone.

In the left one the volume is very low. Because of this the overall experience is getting affected.Also, the mike is too low and you have to hold it up. This is annoying because the whole purpose of headset+mic is to be hands-free. Or you have to talk really loud for the person on line with you to hear properly which defeats the next main usage of headsets for calls - having a private conversation in a public area.

About the product:Loud audio output with good bass. After using it for 2 weeks now I feel this earphone sounds almost similar to Oppo enco m31. It's not right to compare wired and wireless but still the sound quality appears to he same🔥.Delivery and seller: The delivery was real slow (Took 6 days to reach vellore from Bangalore) and the package was found a little damaged. The seal over the box looks tampered and top left corner of the box was not in a good shape.

When this headphone arrived, the first thing that I loved is its packaging. A very stylish and peppy one. Then it comes with extra ear buds which is a plus incase you lose it. The sound quality is amazing and so is the bass of the ear phone. Noise cancellation is also quite good. Overall its the best earphone I have used in a pocket friendly price.

I have been using Boat earphones before so I immediately ordered this piece as soon as I saw there is a lightning deal available. However after using it for a week now, I am a bit disappointed. The sound quality is not that great. I felt the treble was a little too much resulting in the vocals to suppress. Also, when I am using it to answer a call, the mic is capturing the sound of the entire world, which is why I have to literally chew the mic to make myself heard.Last but not the least, the earbuds are not that comfortable. Having said that, the best thing I liked about it is it's phenomenal bass. Well I guess that's why it is called a ""Bass heads"" 😊

Boat bassheads come in attractive colours red, black, pink, green...I bought it twice in last one year... earphones are durable..Only thing that disappointed me are wires that are above microphone for left and right ears..My first purchase go waste as within a week, right wire broke with mild jerk of my leg. They need to improve upon its thickness 👍.Else everything is good for 349 rupees..

I purchased these as my first ever BoAT product to check what is the HYPE all about this brand.Trust me it is not one of the loudest earphones but they do deliver the ""Correct Sound"" and noise cancellations work amazingly.Once plugged to a phone or laptop they are loud enough.If you are looking for a great BASS experience, then let me tell you this will be a little too small of you to get a headphone effect.However the nominal feel of the BASS is amazing and in a quite room it is better and very much relate-able.
"

I bought the earphones looking at the ""best seller"" tag and huge number of reviews.Disappointing to say that some of the notes of instrument are not picking up in this earphones while my other cheap earphone is expressing a good sound quality through music songs.Not a recommended one for sure but if you want to just listen songs without expecting a good sound quality, then you can go for it!

Satisfied. Nothing too fancy. The sound quality is okayish. The built is sturdy.I've been using this for the last few months in a not so gentle manner. It was able to survive my abuse.  I'd definitely recommend it considering the price tag.

So I placed an order on 6th July and it was delivered on 11th. Not even a month has passed and the right ear piece stopped working properly and the mic is pretty much dead. I'm not even a heavy user and I use it like once or twice in 2 days honestly. I'm very careful with products like these and I placed it in a safe place after every use.. It just stopped working on its own. I've contacted boat today, let's see what happensEdit - got the replacement and it's working fine
"

Sound quality is good, the sound may feel scattered around but with an equaliser and little tuning you can get the best audio quality experience at this price range, have almost ordered 10 of these for myself and a lot of friends and family.Audio output is real loud, bass, mids, and lows all sound pretty well, the wire quality is okay for the price the earphones can last with a bit care and doesn't feel cheap aur low quality.I wasted a lot of money in cheap 100~200Rs earphones, these Basshead 100's were the end of my search.Kudos to Boat for such great products.

I am an athlete.Music is very necessary for me while I'm working out. The moment the earphones got sweaty it started malfunctioning.Changed tracks repeatedly and music stopped abruptly. I ripped off the earphones in pieces and burned it down!! It's now used by the fruit seller opposite to my house to hang a bunch of bananas and I tell him to educate ppl about how bad this product is. Cheers!!

I would highly recommend buying these earphones if you wanna get one. The sound quality is absolutely amazing also, I received a small pouch to keep the earphones which was so sweet of them. You also get three pair of earbuds according to the color of your earphones. One is attached to the earplugs & the other two are given separately.
"

Bought the red color and it has a shine which makes it stands out of the crowd,The pun is L shaped which is a huge plus.Not for prolonged use.Best in the division for watching movies.The Bass is a bit higher on the spectrum.The Highs & mids are noticeable.Best to listen at 80% volume above that treble goes screechy.Not for audio fans but an excellent one for normal daily usage.The sound cancellation is the reason you should buy it when it goes on sale.

I wanted to buy a decent earphone with mic and this one was on sale. I thought what could go wrong with an earphone. I have learned a lesson. This is truly the worst earphone i have used in my life and trust me i have used discarded, damaged earphones but this one beats them all. This causes ear pain and is unfit for human use.

I bought a headphones before it for 800rs . When I lost that I bought it for same quality expectations. It's cheaper than that but it was discounted price so I expect for same quality but it's not upto mark .It's an average headphone.Find something better and tell me pls.

A good product of the respective price point.Sound Quality, material quality and durability is what you would expect at this price point not bad but not too good either. Well a little bit on the good side you can say. But, my product started to have complications on the left ear after about 3 months, and as always boAt happily replaced the product. The Velcro strap was a good addition.Overall the product is good (at this price point). And any complications within a year are no problem as boAt readily replaces the product in a hassle free process.
"

They are just amazing. Don't hurt ears due to rubber attached at the ends. Even the pack contains 2 more sets of rubber pieces in case u lose any of them which is quiet a relief. External noise cancellation is simply amazing. Can block more than 80% of external noise. Sound quality is also excellent. Overall a good choice at this price.

boat rockerz 100 wire earphone is good. This is great to talk about. I am using it since 4 months. Even if I keep the mic of this earphone inside the jacket, the voice of the person talking in front can be heard very clearly. The song is fine to hear but the bass is low.Those who want to talk more can take it.

Its an average product.. Sound quality and bass is below expectations. Sometimes when the jack moves the sound in one ear bud stops then I adjust it and it comes again and this is something which started within 2 weeks of use. Not money well spent.

No noise cancellation. It takes in more of the background noise than what is spoken into the mike. Otherwise, in a calm area, this is the best.Sound quality is nice.Earphones are surprisingly durable. I've been using them since the last 6 months. They still work. I'm going to buy another pair now.

I used the earphones for 8 months then one of the earphone stopped working then the other in A couple of days.  I was worried and claimed the warranty,  as the boat service is very good (excellent)  they had replaced with a new set of earphones.  I gave 5 start because of their service and Don't worry if your earphones got damaged within warranty period then boat service is with you.  Quick replacement in the sense it takes 20- 30 days but these many days are for to check defective product and to replace the item from head office it depends on distance.

The quality is good. But, after 1 month one side is not working. I don't know what is the problem. I have 1 year warranty and i registered a complaint on thier website. They asked me the invoice and picked up the product for checking. And they replaced it. And i got new one. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

They are saying one year warranty but insist on the invoice. Inspite of sharing screenshots they refuse to register the warranty claim.  Amazon does not  have all old invoices on the app. Basically they want to sell but not owe up in case of a defect within warranty period.
"

So these headphones are unique. They targets the air chamber between your ear drum and headphones to induce a bass like sensation. They literally vibrate your eardrums instead of having a actuall mechanism inbuilt in the earbuds. I guess this may have some impact on your ear drums on a long run?
"
779,"
DESIGN IS ACTUALLY IRRELEVANT!The hawk shaped back is the actual flaw; but that's why I bought it (instant regret).The design looks cool but the ergonomics is really obsructive. This point, the hawk thing,  impales the ear, which is unbearable and universal; until you have an Elephant's ear.This experience ruins a good music, absolutely.I will be returning this for real and Believe me BETTER GO FOR SIMPLE-ROUND ERGONOMIC BACK. I repeat, SIMPLE-ROUND.

Quality of the cable is very good and strong.. Felt the sound quality is low and the noise cancelation as well is not soo good. Couldn't hear properly when the fan is on at full speed..

Been using it for 1+ year now, still working great and in good condition. The bass is low, but bassboost can cover up for it plentily. So you have an option to enjoy music without overpowering bass. It's also really light and can be used for long sessions without discomfort. In terms of comfort and lightness it's better than bassheads 225. Well worth the money, but not for bassheads.

I used these earphones for like 2 years, and they're best in this price range, sound quality is phenomenal atleast for me, audio clarity is great, these earphones have survived being washed in my washing machines, treated them like dirt but they're still usable today although rubbers have started to come out from aux and ear piece and don't look presentable but they work.

So far I've used this and 152, 162 and multiple other boat earphones and Bluetooth headphones and TWS but so far- THIS MODEL is the BEST. you know for 350rs you are set for minimum 1 year and Max 2. I think it's a pretty good deal- and if it breaks after a year or has the oil leak (which btw all boat earphones do), still won't hurt your pocket.

I have been using it from last 6 months without any issue. Previously none of my earphones lasted more than 1-2 months but this is exceptional quality of earphones made by this brand.

After purchasing these earphone, I have more confidence in this brand for other peoducts as well.

Zero noise cancellation.If you are expecting this product will cancel all the background noise during a call. Then you are all wrong, this can amplify all the noise but will not reduce. So i will call it a big drawback.

Cables are somewhat tangle free.Base of loud but it destroys the original intent. Like it dosent suits 90% of the songs.Music is not balanced at all, mids and highs after not clear at all.Noice reduction is great, earbuds are comfortable, metal gets wayyy too cold in winter.

The problem is durability. After buying it hardly lasted for 4-5 months and i have to give it for replacement and sit idle for 20days without earphone.

This is the third time I'm buying this. Because I like it? Maybe Yes, It does it jobs well but not really the earphones stop working every 3 months which is kinda annoying that I waste Rs. 400 when a normal Rs. 100 can be cost effective  .

Just received today, I am sharing the initial impression after a couple of hours of use. It can be very helpful for you to decide how worthy the product is and should you buy it or not. After using it for a while I noticed that the build is not that good. It's completely plastic made, no metal rings and the wire is not of untangled type. It can tangle if u r not tying it properly. And the wire is thin so u would have to see to it that you are handling it properly. It is light weight and that's probably because it is sports friendly. It can get easily tucked inside the ears and the fit is nice. It will remain in the ear even if you are using it while running, dancing or during any such events. The warranty card comes inside the box that you can use for availing warranty as the contact details have been listed on it. Overall durability seems to be an issue if you are a very rough user. However I can say it would last a good time if you are regularly tying and keeping it in a bag or any such case or pouch after every use. Sound quality is awesome, not like those high end ones but still for the price it's good. That is one thing that I really about it. Now it says it has noise cancellation and it works really nice. That is also because it has been given a slight angle for the buds to get inside the ear a bit more than the regular ones making it to be giving a complete sound experience without annoying noise. The Bass is good, can't say it is wonderous or will take you to heaven, its just good and you would actually notice the real bass when the volume is turned up to Max. However that might cause irritation and ear pain as the loudness hypes up to making the song a piece of noise so I suggest using it at a moderate value. Mic is not that good. However it can be used for regular stuffs like attending calls. It can't be used for professional purposes like making YouTube videos. Again, that's completely your choice to use it as a primary mic for your stuffs.I have described what I noticed and got to know. You should also consider other reviews.

Very bad quality . I had bought it in the month of May and already one ear of the headphone isn't working . Also everytime I plug it in , it causes some disruption or the other and the microphone malfunctions and keeps turning on my Google Voice . It also starts other audio applications by itself . I have contacted customer service , but their website kept crashing everytime .I really want a refund because I had spent my hard earned money on it . Very disappointed .

I’ve been using this headphones for few months now. Mainly use it while driving. It has been very convenient for taking up calls while driving and it’s seamless.

For 400 they are good and sound quality is just fine. They have no brass or noise cancellation feature. But i didn't need them so I got these for regular use. Yes they are durable and it is genuine.

This earphones sounds horrible at full volume & doesn't impress with its sound quality even at low sound level.

It's all relative. If you compare the bass with CX-180 (~Rs 700-800), the bass is not that good. I bought these just coz the name was Bassheads. If you really enjoy music and could afford more get the CX180. The bass and overall sound quality is amazing in those. For the same budget as these earphones, I think the bass is decent but can't be too sure because haven't tried other products in this price range.

I have ordered 2 Boat earphones, and one of them were defective, then I have return one and recieved another earphone from same distributor, then again it was defective, and now the remaining first one is left with me. I think it was not an issue from Company ""Boat"", but its an issue from the Distributor Appario Retail Pvt Ltd, since i recieved 3 pair and its not possible that every piece is defective. This distributor provided me defective old earphones.

I have used low range to high range of earphones. Recently I have purchased 100 Rs local earphone while traveling due to emergency. It is giving really best sound quality. But this one not even to that level. Especially if you are a music lover don’t go for this and you will be disappointed. My disappointment with the product is that they mentioned extra bass but there is no bass at all.

Wrost product didn't expect from boat first I think may be my item was defective so I ordered replacement but it same as previous one. Name is boat bass headphones but no bass at all only sharp irritating sound even I can't hold them at my ear for five second when full volume so disappointed didn't expect products like this from boat no return option only replacement so I lost my money.,
"

The company says that it has super extra bass...bt after experiencing, the bass quality is very normal & there is no extra bass.this is quite minimal,sound quality is ok.. the placing of microphone is little far from one's face so that during calling there may be some problem for the guy on the other side of call.this is my replacement product. Previous one has some connectivity issues through 3.5 mm jack.plz be sure about it after receiving.

I have used this product earlier also, which was excellent and after that earphone was stolen, I ordered another piece (in fact two). But, This black earphone is not working after just one month of purchase. Only one ear's speaker is functional and another one is mostly disconnected. I have tried connecting this earphone to my laptop and several mobiles and the problem is persistent. I need a replacement.

Used the black colour edition for almost 1 and half year then they stopped working.So I bought RCB ❤️ edition this time because I have no issues with the previous one. Sound quality is damn good with 10mm drivers inside it. Getting a 350rs earphones for 1 and half year is just amazingWhat special with this edition is gold plating for the 3.5mm headphone jack which lacks in normal edition

Please music lovers don't buy this. Worst earphone till now, the sound quality is not at all good, it does not fit to ears and keep dropping again and again, and greatest demerit as you keep on increasing sound voice start blasting in ear.
"
837,"
The sound quality is pretty good, and it's kind of comfortable too, provided you're wearing in less than 4 hours straight. The ears start to hurt a lil bit after that. The output is way better than I expected it to be, mids could have been a kil better but the highs and lows are good. And it gets really loud, didn't notice too much distortion at 100% volumeAnd it looks cool too, its tiny and fits perfectly in my ear, your fit may vary tho
"

It is a great product for it's price though my only complaint is the cable it is not a strong cable and it will break after rough use though boat's customer service is so good that they replaced the product 3 times since I use products very roughlyA good product would recommend to a friend if they need cheap headphones

Got this in lightning deal for Rs.379 and for the price this is the best earphone you can buy right now at that segment.OVERALL SPECS RATINGS ~~~Build quality (3/5)Durability (3.5/5)Wire length and tangle free(4/5)Sound quality (5/5)Microphone (4/5)Ear comfort (5/5)This product met my expectations....Thanks Amazon ❤️....EDIT**::::-----  After using 6 months , it is still working fine as usual, the sound quality is still maintained, sound quality is very good, so feel proving a worth buying this. There is also almost no problem while wearing for longer hours!

If purely sound output is considered, this takes the cake. Over a month's usage now, I'm fully satisfied with the sound, given the price here. The mic is positioned at a little lower than where a person would speak, and that would be annoying while taking calls. Keep this in mind before ordering one.
"
841,"
The ear phones are worth their money. I basically bought to be used for call and it works as it's supposed to. The quality is good as well. But if you are looking to use it for listening to music and you have a bigger budget then u should go for some others. But having said that, you can still use this earphone for music as well. Overall it's worth it's money.

All over product is good but noise cancellation is somewhere missing and bass was also decent but sometimes only sometimes u might feel that one side of earphone is working after few seconds it would be as same...And according to price product is decent but after adding few amount u might get a better product with good sound and bass quality...👍👍👍

I got it at 380 which is almost good for basic use.Bass is goodPitch is very high.. so confirm first that volume is low then put in it in ear.Overall loudness is high so you can clearly listen your fav song while traveling in train or bus. I had used JBL, SONY almost all are same under 800. You can't feel the difference. So go for pocket friendly earphone.Don't use it while you are crossing road or rail track.

This might be a compatibility issue with my two mobiles I used these headphones on but they performed very poorly on both of them. The old stock earphones that I had were much better than these. Amazon came to my rescue and issued refund.
"

These earphones are amazing value for money. The decibel range is perfect for everyday listening, while the bass quality is outstanding. Noise cancellation is not what it was designed for, but for this price point, its bang-for-the-buck. Moreover, even at higher volumes, if not inside the ear and left freely, the music is not audible, granting some amount of comfort from the shrill noise such open earphones make to others standing nearby. IMO, this is one budget earphone one must look to.

It does not work more than 1 month. Neither Amazon nor boat support provide any solution. I wasted my money for buying this product.

I have used it for 5-6 months and I want to say it has very good build quality but the sound quality you expect at this price point is not that good even 100rupees earphones have better bass than this.

Not a quality product as boat is offering.Very uncomfortable, very slippery, sounds are hurting on ear drum. Feels like hearing music on local road side stuff.Will not recommend anyone to buy this, you may extend a bit in budget and buy a better one, this is neither good nor value for money.

This product is awesome, it's bass and all other quality things are very much near to Mi Basic Earphones, but the noise cancelation is very nice in Boat, it feels I'm just not able to listen anything outside, it's awesome.Design : 8/10Sound : 8/10Hardware : 7/10Bass : 7/10 (very close to Mi Basic, but I still think Mi Basic is bit better in terms of Bass.)Noise Cancelation : 9/10 (If you use a earbuds which are more suitable for your ears, then definitely noise cancelation is beast.)

Both my friend and me purchased this same product within a span of 15 days and both of us faced the same problem with this headphone.

I will provide my updated review once i communicate to the seller through amazon customer care.

I'm totally dissatisfied with the product as I've experienced the poor quality for  three times especially in red color. It's not functioning properly just within 10 days of delivery and replacement window is disabled with unacceptable rules set by them... In addition to that, there's no proper contact details or platform to raise our honest concern. We as a customer expect a service and loyalty, more than the brand. I strongly recommend not to buy this, even if they sell it for least price.

Good product with great sound quality and build quality... But here i want to mention about there after sell service, about its warranty... I had problem with my unit and i filled complaint about it and they replaced it, thair cc person came to my home and took my unit and send it to head office and they checked it and replace it... Just want to mention while giving your defective unit make sure u are not giving any accessories like ear buds, valcrow and box coz they will not return it... 😅

Ordered this product before 5 months, and now the earphones had Jack issue so they were not connecting properly. But no signs of worry as it is having 1 year warranty. And Boat has the best service. Just went to Boat website and raised a complaint by filling required details and they got the product replaced within a week.
"

The product is clearly overrated.  For 500 bucks i would say the product is overpriced,  it's just the brand you are paying.  The build is quite light, it looks like one of those local Chinese earphones . The sound quality is okayish.  My complementary Samsung earphones provided  better sound quality. The wire lenght is just fine not too long , easy to detangle. Noise cancellation is good though and bass is alright. At times the voice gets buzzy  even after being properly connected.

Honest, Crisp Review after an usage after 5 months.Purchased on October 9, 2019.Pros,Bass- Good but not so comparable to MI Basic Earphones. Go for MI. 3/5Sound Quality- Kind of similar to MI Basic Earphones. 4/5Tangle- Boat rocks in this segment.

I will write a review after sturdy usage.

I is a very good product for what we are paying. Its length is really appropriate and this avoids excessive entangling sound quality is moderate is really good for non technical and less usage.Comes with a case two extra pair of buds and a one year warranty.The color is bright and have used it for few days but looks unwearable as like other earphones that wear there color off.Ear bud size and quality is good does not hurt your ears.

The after sale service is more then worst. It last for few months if you use carefully. But once it stops working there is no use of warranty. You can do what ever you want but can't get repaired or replaced. Nor the company bothers about you. It's better to buy same range product from any other manufacturers. You will always get scripted reply on all channels.

They sound exactly like those ₹70 earphones that you can find from street vendors and mobile accessory shops. I know these aren't expensive earphones, I bought them for ₹400 and didn't expect the sound to be ""Amazing"" but still for ₹400 you can find something better. There's no bass whatsoever. I don't know why they call it ""BassHeads"". The packing was great, came with a warranty card, A net/case, extra buds. But Soundwise, these suck big time, You'll be disappointed.

this was my 2 Boat earphones i bought one for my Friend, i am not sure what happened but the sound and bass quality of the 2nd earphone is such a worse compared to the previous one, i believe this was a defective product that i received under the sale from Boat, but anyways the 1st one was good, and noise cancellation is offered because of rubber buds which might make you feel uncomfortable if you are not used to it.

Its my second pair.. these are nice..good sound qualityBut the best thing I like about boat products is their warranty.

For a price this low, the quality of the earphone is excellent. Having used Sony, Sennheiser, Audio Technica and JBL earphones, I must say this earphone quite matches the sound quality of the above mentioned high end earphones.

If you are looking for the best quality of earphones below Rs.400, then the boAt bassheads 100 hawk earphones are the best ones. I currently use the Taffy Pink one and I'm totally in love with it. It does the work of noise cancelation very well and as the name of the product suggests, the bass part of music is just awesome.I totally go for the looks apart from the quality and working and I'm totally in love with the look 💟Its totally tangle free because the wires are thick plus, there is a really cool velcro with which the earphones are rolled and tied up with. So no chances of tangling if maintained well.It sits comfortably in the ear and does not cause any sort of ear pain unlike my previous earphones whose brand I wouldn't want to mention.On the whole, the best earphones I've ever used! ❤️

Very average product.  Ear buds are not comfortable. There is no sound setting button. Do not expect good from this product. In my opinion Rs.200/- is better. otherwise footpath earphones or better. we will get below Rs.100/-

I have used Boat accessories and I was confident in my purchase. But the earphone are of subpar quality, talking on the phone is a pain because you have to hold the mouthpiece up and talk which defeats the whole purpose of having it, the sound quality on these is also not as good as the other earphones from this brand. Overall it was underwhelming, the price is reasonable however the quality is subpar. I’d spend another two hundered and get a better pair of headphones.

Waste of money! Sound coming from earphones leaks from the mic and it becomes very difficult to communicate with the person because he can hear echo of his voice from my mic!absolutely disheartening because i cannot even return them during lockdown

The BoAt BassHeads 100 are a pretty good earphones for the price point. It is very good if you want to use for daily purposes and not concerned about the in depth music quality. The Mic works really well and the audio is clear. It also has a 1 year warranty, so it's pretty decent. One thing that no one likes is getting a problem in their earphones, which I faced in 6-7 months after buying, but that's an average lifetime of an earphones these days, so not complaining.

Pin is very small.. If you will keep your phn pin will come out, if you will move your hands pin will come out. Overall worst product Nd another worst thing is that you can't return this item. So be careful before wasting your money in this.

excellent quality of sound. i bought this earphones for my desktop initially i was not sure about the sound quality of this earphones because of the price. i bougth for 400rs. whan i first plugged in and heard a song i was blown away by the  quality of the sound very crisp and clear zero distortion. I have bose QC 35 2 i'm very much used to that. i really admire the sound quality of this earphones highs,lows and mids were excellent. you couldn't get any earphones at this price range....the best part is it really sounds simalar to 30k headphones.

I purchased these before but the orange ones and they came in with braided wire. Thinking the same, ordered it again but in black but these turned out to be the regular wired ones. So read the specifics carefully as not all the colours have the same features.

The main thing I like about this earphone is 1. It will work for almost 1+ years without any problem that is a fair time period if we compare the price of it.2. And if you have any problem with it you can replace/ repair it, by uploading the invoice and the pickup will be done from your home no need to go to any shop.

I roughed it up very much but this is a beast earphone it just wont die man. I dropped it in a puddle, in snow its just a but weak against heat. A sticky layear forms when the weather gets too hot and the headphones are untouched for a long time but it gets off by a cloth soaked in water. One of the best products in my possession since i cant live without music.

One of the worse ear phone brand ever. After buying within a month. The left earbud stopped working. This is ridiculous after buying multiple times this occurs and everytime this is so painful.
"
931,"
I am very disappointed, just look at its picture, mic is shown attached to the right headphone, but zoom it and you can clearly see they have attached it there separately only for the picture(Very bad editing). Mic is actually at the place from which the wire splits out in to 2, which is very far from our mouth and you need to bring it closer to your mouth while speaking. Returning this right now!! I will order one which has mic attached to any one of the 2 split headphones.

I love this product. It's simple, beautiful and powerful. I can say this is the better than the best you can get at this price range.

Product seems to be good. I would have given more stars ,but only after two months one of the side of earphone stopped working.

The product is very good for rough and tough use. Perfect bass quality. EDM tracks were perfect. Sound quality and noise cancellation is very good. Although the size of the earpiece as shown in the image is larger than in reality....the red color looks a little cheap but it's the sound that matters and it's worth the price.

I go through many headphones like sony, redmi ear capsules, jbl. But this one is best in this range. Other headphones like sony is also good and still in working condition. I bought sony and boat in June 2018. Today the boat is stopped working. But sony is still on. In term comfortability the boat goes with 5/5. For bass and price 5/5. I used this headphone roughly and it worked well.Hats off for heavy-duty. Thanks for such a great headphone.

If your only purpose is to listen songs then i can recommend it for such people who don't care about Noise cancellation. Noise cancellation seems to be not at all in this product.Rest everything is good.You get a pouch to keep the earphones which is actually good instead of keeping anywhere.

The earphones quality is good. Wire is sturdy and tangle free. Now coming on the actual work, bass is not as profound as Bassheads 225 and max volume is also not comparable with Bassheads 225. But noise cancellation is superior than Bassheads 225 and fits better due to plastic design. It's a great product for people who don't necessarily listen to head banging music.

Looks durable so far, considering the JBL C100SI ones broke in 6 months.Ordered 2 pink, 1 black and 1 white unit. No problems in any one so far. The wire wrapper might be a bit annoying to some 'cause it sticks to almost everything, but i guess it is a small price to pay for convenience.Also there is no volume button, and no option to fast forward or rewind a song, which the JBL had.

Crap earphones. Useful if you need a spare like I did. Wouldn't use them as my main earphones; just too devoid and lackluster. If your ears have ever tasted premium quality, you'll laugh at the quality of these earphones. I needed a secondary pair so I bought these based on reviews. Hoped these would somehow turn out to be good. But no, got exactly what I should have expected. For others like me, beware; these are cheap-sounding.

Amazing Earphone I ever seen. Bass Is excellent treble was excellent.______Update:- After 1.5 Years Of Use I'm Upgrading my earphones from Boat Basshead 100 to Boat Basshead 225.Because I mistakenly Drop my earphone And Right Side Bud Broken. I tried to fixed it Through Feviquick but didn't worked so I soldered the wiring because wires also detached from the driver after soldering It was working fine but it wasn't loud. So I ordered Basshead 225. Otherwise they are Durable if you use them properly.

For this price product is ok(rs 349). But overall not a great product. Bass quality is superb. But i don't know why people boast it. Once you get a headphone with immersive sound quality you never choose for bass only. I had a mi headphone which superb for immersive experience. Comparing that this is not good. I suggest buy more quality headphone if you can afford the price. Its good if your budget is around 400rs

Pros:1) Very good sound quality.2) Good noise cancellation.3) Comfortable even after long hours of listening.4) Design and build quality is great. I personlly don't like metallic built earphones, they're kind of uncomfortable to the ears and heavy.5) Good wire- tangle free and comes with appropriate length.6) A good buy at this price.Cons:1) For being a bassheads model, not too much bass, but can be improved from equalizer settings.2) Earphone jack is straight.

I have used this for one month now...I used amazon basics before this one for 1.5 years. They had fad far better sound as well as bass quality than this one...Boat has got more middle frequency and sounds fat. The design looks appealing but I am not satisfied with the sound. For wire, there is no damage till now but I am pretty suspicious for how long would it last. The length is just a bit small for me. Also the buds did not fit my ear correctly. I am using the old ones from my previous earphones and they are very comfortable for me.

Excellent bass above 70% of volume. Sometime you will feel vibration of bass in 100% volume.😀Nice build quality.Ear tip fits well.You get this earphone, extra pair of eartip (small and large) and collor clip in the box. Neon green colour looks very nice.Didn't find any con after listening to 12-15 different genres songs, call quality is also good.Go for it in this price range (450-500).Though I received an open box but its not related to product quality. 1 less star for delivery and packing.

This is a product review after using it for straight 2 hours since it just got delivered today.What an improvement firstly from the boat bassheads 225.Now, i dont know what the other negative reviews are about since i personally did not find any issue whatsoever with these infact i am delighted by it.If you are looking a for a good wired earphone and dont want to spend much then this would be the best budget earphone in the market right now.Firstly speaking of the body it is plastic and not metallic and so it has become lighter than the previous bassheads so much that after using it for 2 straight hours i almost forgot i had them put on. I just felt the wire could have been a bit thicker but dont forget the wire is braided and coated with a rubber like material which should resolve that dilemma.These come with ear hooks which to my surprise were so comfortable. I usually hate ear hooks cause they hurt after a while but these are just so soft and fit right in.Moving on the main purpose and the bigger question ""BASS"".I would say it's perfect.The sound quality is so very crisp and clear.BASS is in the right spot and according to me you dont need anymore.You may hear from other reviewers the BASS is not as good as the previous bassheads please understand it depends on what kind of music you listen and mostly the KBPS which is kilo bits per second. The higher the kbps the better the sound including bass and treble.The loudness is great almost deafening at the highest volume.To check noise cancellation (although these earphones dont say noise cancellation) I made a few phone calls and asked if they heard any background noise and they said they could hear little to nothing of whats happening in the background. Now ofcourse this is in a normal environment and may not cancel the traffic sounds or a loud background noise.The added advantage is the IPX4 sweat and water resistance (you dont find this feature in most wired earphones atleast not in this price range) which is great specially when you work out or when you are jogging or talking a walk. Although since it is wired you will find discomfort and so may want to get wireless bluetooth earphones instead.So heres how i would rate it on a scale of 1 - 5, 5 being the highest and 1 being the lowest.Price: 5Build Quality: 4.5 ( Only cause i think the wire could have been a little thicker)Loudness: 5Call Quality: 5Bass: 5 (The bass is just perfect if any more bass than this you'd better be putting your ears on a  loudspeaker).Hope this clarifies your doubts about this product.All in all yet another great product from BOAT and you wont regret the purchase.

This is the true earphone to connect you to nirvana not for longer times because it starts pain in ear after a long time continuous use.Bass- in the price of 450, bass is terrible. You will get powerful bass than you expect.Sound- if a headphone has poor sound, it is not a headphone. But this one has the sound that will blow your mind totally.Noice cancellation- in the price range of 400-500 no brand will give you perfect noice cancellation headphones, but in boat bassheads, there is noice cancellation but not so good.Overall- if you have 500 rs. And you are searching for beast headphone in you budget and if you are reading reviews, and if you are reading this one, i am telling you go for it without hesitation beacuse after a long research on 2 shopping sites i found thi product best in my price range.(i bouggt it for 450).

It is second day of my usage. I went for run with this ear phones. They claim to be sweat proof but after 2 minutes of run my mic and volume button are giving false signals. Automatically music gets change and volume goes to zero all of sudden. I think this is because of sweat and mic is mis-operating.I think we should not call earphones sweat protection if any of the system is friendly for sweat. completely disappointed with product.

Just overdid it on the bass. There is virtually no treble. The singers voice just gets muted. Good for pew pew Hindi, pop, hip-hop type songs. I guess that's why they are sold in India. Not for metalheads! Also the eargrips are uncomfortable after long use. Needless addition. Durability I will comment a few months later. But for the price can't complain. It's no Bose.

AFTER 2 WEEKS OF DAILY 1-2 HR USEPROS:Sound quality is ear deafening... u can use it with 70-80% more than that u cant ..or u r crazy ...BASS 5/5I feel the price is affordable.5/5The wire are very durable 5/5(Wires with nylon outer cover as of i know )the buttons 5/5I use it as a daily driver in gym it wont come unless u take it out.Cons: After using it for 60-70 minutes you will feel slight discomfort due to the ear wing and  also you feel discomfort whiling  using it in while on a pillow in bed.( the ear hooks are detachable) it gives more comfort.but it is the best wired headset in the range and it is better than their own 225 headphones...i highly recommend it for people who need A good bass headphones

I was looking for midrange earphones from quite sometime for my workouts and running .but this piece of earphone is upto my mark asIt is perfectly grip in my ears no fear of falling while running,Clear and metallic soundGood bass ,Look wise it is awesome.Braided wire means strengthAfter using it for few days there is change in sound pattern  so I returned it. And I'm changing my review from 5 stars to 2

Loved this earphone its bass is out standing... build quality is great...if you're getting it for 449... Grab it. It's better than boat 225 and ant w56.. good for jogging. Design is not so Good but build quality is great. Get black color earphones. And cherry on top is it's has volume control buttons too... nobody gives volume control buttons in this price.

As they promised that the quality of wire is too good but it is not.. the wire got damaged with in very short time at the joint as shown in the pic. I cannot replace now not sure how to claim warranty. Can someone (Amazon) help me to get this replaced or repaired?I will mark it as 5 star if it is replaced.

Excellent bass above 70% of volume. Sometime you will feel vibration of bass in 100% volume.😀Nice build quality.Ear tip fits well.You get this earphone, extra pair of eartip (small and large) and collor clip in the box. Neon green colour looks very nice.Didn't find any con after listening to 12-15 different genres songs, call quality is also good.Go for it in this price range (450-500).Though I received an open box but its not related to product quality. 1 less star for delivery and packing.

This is a product review after using it for straight 2 hours since it just got delivered today.What an improvement firstly from the boat bassheads 225.Now, i dont know what the other negative reviews are about since i personally did not find any issue whatsoever with these infact i am delighted by it.If you are looking a for a good wired earphone and dont want to spend much then this would be the best budget earphone in the market right now.Firstly speaking of the body it is plastic and not metallic and so it has become lighter than the previous bassheads so much that after using it for 2 straight hours i almost forgot i had them put on. I just felt the wire could have been a bit thicker but dont forget the wire is braided and coated with a rubber like material which should resolve that dilemma.These come with ear hooks which to my surprise were so comfortable. I usually hate ear hooks cause they hurt after a while but these are just so soft and fit right in.Moving on the main purpose and the bigger question ""BASS"".I would say it's perfect.The sound quality is so very crisp and clear.BASS is in the right spot and according to me you dont need anymore.You may hear from other reviewers the BASS is not as good as the previous bassheads please understand it depends on what kind of music you listen and mostly the KBPS which is kilo bits per second. The higher the kbps the better the sound including bass and treble.The loudness is great almost deafening at the highest volume.To check noise cancellation (although these earphones dont say noise cancellation) I made a few phone calls and asked if they heard any background noise and they said they could hear little to nothing of whats happening in the background. Now ofcourse this is in a normal environment and may not cancel the traffic sounds or a loud background noise.The added advantage is the IPX4 sweat and water resistance (you dont find this feature in most wired earphones atleast not in this price range) which is great specially when you work out or when you are jogging or talking a walk. Although since it is wired you will find discomfort and so may want to get wireless bluetooth earphones instead.So heres how i would rate it on a scale of 1 - 5, 5 being the highest and 1 being the lowest.Price: 5Build Quality: 4.5 ( Only cause i think the wire could have been a little thicker)Loudness: 5Call Quality: 5Bass: 5 (The bass is just perfect if any more bass than this you'd better be putting your ears on a  loudspeaker).Hope this clarifies your doubts about this product.All in all yet another great product from BOAT and you wont regret the purchase.

I purchased this boat hadset, initially it was working excellent but after 2 months, I don't know whether it's a design issues or might be other problem, I contacted service center of boat. They denied to replace my headphone, staff said me that it's a special cricketer editon so I need to complain via online from the boat website and I registered a complete raised ticket but still now no reply. Poor service. till date no reply from  BOAT. kindly think before buying boat products.

If you want durable earphone, protected from sweat, water. Go for this.Build quality: Very good form factor, braided cable with waterproof coating. Eartips are comfortable and fits nicely, looks durable.Sound: Boat earphone, hence Bass rich, treble and mids could have been better (as I listen music in studio monitors, so I felt, not a big issue)Downsides: Wire seems very durable, but not too thick. Could've been thicker. Extra eartips only 2 small and 2 mediums. Couldve been provided more.Overall you can surely take this if you badly need waterproofing and durability, otherwise 225/152/162 has slightly better sound. But this has volume control keys, thats a plus point.

Before these earphones, I used the basic Samsung earphones which were 5 years old.And I am writing this review after 3 days of usage,daily for 3-4 hours.Pros:  1- Crystal clear & loud sound.  5/52- Amazing bass.  5/53-Call quality is fine. 4/54- The wires are braided which make them more durable.  5/5One of the most amazing features is that you get sound control buttons in this earphones which work as a charm.Cons :1- After continuous use for 45-60 mins, they cause pain in ears.2- They are MADE IN CHINA.  I didn't know it before.Edit: After daily usage of almost 1 week, the right earplug is not working properly and they are causing hell lot of pain and itchiness on the ear.I am reducing the rating from 4 stars to 1. Also I have applied for replacement.I really wish, somehow refund would be possible, as I don't want to waste 500 Rs.

Best for me. If you fall in the middle category, where you don't want the best of the best earphones but also don't want the worst, go for this.Earbuds don't fall from my ears! My ears are kind of weird. Like Amir Khan (lol). (I have had a bad past with regards to this with my previous earphones).Bass is gooood. Sound clarity is also good. Some experts may say the vocal clarity is overshadowed by the bass, but I am okay with that.The clip is very useful in preventing the earbuds from falling. I clip it on my collar.The cable strength is also good. The cable got pulled twice by accident, and nothing happened to the earphones.The mic is also good. I use these earphones to listen to music, watch YouTube, calling, send and listen to voice notes, etc.Best. Cheers!Don't think too much :)

Earler ive used jbl, philips, sony and mi earphones. But this stands top of all.  And i personally call it baap of all in this price segment.  Even 1500 segment of jbl and sanheiser.

In this price range it's the best option. If you have higher budget it's not the best. The problems I faced are high bass at higher volume levels, destroying the song... Recommend listening at 65 to 75 for best results (pretty good clarity at this level). Next is usage time after like 1to 2 hours, ears start to pain and becomes uncomfortable.Pro's1. Best fit, it will not fall out.2. HD sound at approx 70 percent volume.3. Mic is good not the best. Manageable at this price range4. Noise cancellation good blocks 90 percent of the backround noise.Overall best in its price range. Don't expect much, you see it's not a Bose.
"
1031,"
Okay, some people may differ but in my opinion the bass is too much. So much that it overpowers all the other aspects of the song. If you're into EDM where it's basically bass and.... just bass, then I guess it's a good fit. But if you want to hear other genre of music, then I would advise not to buy this product. The bass is just painful and I had to return the product and buy Sennheiser CX180 instead. It's too good for the price range.

My second Boat earphone is also stop working within three months. What is this, and there is no response from your side regarding my first earphone replacement from many days (ticket no. 1154217)You guys are not responsing about my complain, is this way to deal with your costumers. Your call center is not picking up call. You give warranty of your product and when I claim for warranty you stop responding me. I bought two earphones and both are not working.  bad product.... After three months of use it will show different types problems.. And there is no response from company when you go for warranty. I have two same earphones and within 3 months both are not working.

The overall sound quality is good, this is a good sports earphone for the price, but you get another earphone that's far superior than these, at the same price. They are called Leaf Bolt.Leaf Bolt's sound quality and bass is far superior than Boat Bassheads 242. And I have worn them in showering rain multiple times and they have remained absolutely fine due to their water resistance tech. Go for Leaf Bolt instead if you want overall better experience and comfort as well. Or go for Realme Buds 2 or Boat Bassheads 225 if you are obsessed with earth shattering bass for this price range.

Very flimsy! Not meant for runners, sports or even walking for that matter.The wiring inside the mic assembly where other buttons like volume controls are placed was shorting causing volume commands to be activated on slight movement of the cord around the mic module. Buy it if you still want to experiment and don't mind loosing your money. Keep the packaging for at least till the return window in case you buy it.

The headphone are of very good quality but the service is WORST!!! I faced the typical boat issue of one side not working after 6months. I reached customer care and they had a pickup but it's been a month and there is no update. Whenever I try to call customer care it gets disconnected frequently and by chance if it gets connected then the executive doesn't cooperates and says the same thing that it would be dispatched tomorrow and this countinues for over 4 weeks now. Have had this experience previously with bassheads225 but still I chosed to buy boat product again. But not making the same mistake again. If you wanna buy boat products consider buying a newer one again after 6 months, coz this is validity of there products.

I was confused whether I should return or not.  I have done the sound test on this boat earphone and I compared with JBL. I tried to see the difference in the same music.  I am going to do sound test on Vivo earphones.  I tried to use both earphones on vivo s1 phone.Pros (why you should buy)1. Good bass(bass lover should like it)2. Awesome wire quality.  Tangle free, durable and beautiful.3. 1 year warranty4.You can remove the sports cap if you are not using for sportsCons(not to buy)1. Treble is 0. No treble.  Bass treble should have balance.  Sound quality decreased.  It looks someone is pressing the neck of the singer.2. There is no surround sound.  The earphones with surround sound gives pleasure.  The left music should play in left earphone and right in right earphone. It is lacking.3.if boat Will work on above two points.  This earphon will be awesome.4. The earphone is not comfortable for long time music.  You have to remove the cap.  The boat should release half earphones like apple and vivo. The earphone is comfort after removing cap.

 Sound quality 5/5Noise cancellation 4/5Bass quality 4.5 / 5Best headphones in this budget.Long lasting.I am ordering this headphone 2 nd time. my 1st headphones lasted for 2 years with 3-4 hours daily usage for office calls.It’s tangle free only problem is dust is accumulated on it over the period of 2 years and you need to clean it occasionally.I have ordered blue colour and look wise it’s very vibrant and beautiful.

It works properly for just 3 months after it bacames worst than any thing else after claiming my warranty it took to clear 1 month.

So while purchasing read review.

Looking at lot of good reviews, I think the opinion probably differs with people.. Sound quality is definitely better than any low profile earphones, but bass quality seems to be so unnatural, boosted to much that gives pain in the ears.Pros: Ear piece stick to the ear comfortably, Sound quality is decent enough, call quality is goodCons: Boosted bass sound spoils the original music (some may like it) it hurts the ear drum in short time of listening to the songs. `This is the first day review, if my opinion change after some days of usage, will get back to change the rating.

Great earphone, I purchased in ₹549, though currently it is available in ₹499 . Little disappointed.Sound is amazing, cable is not that great, there are 3 buttons available. It is better than mi basic earphone that comes in 399/-You can go for it without any doubt.Edit :-After 7 months of use suddenly it's mic has stopped working and in single attempt it doesn't connect with phone and I have to unplug and plug again to connect with phone. Mic and the buttons stopped working and this is the biggest issue with these earphone. Although sound output is still good. Just after warranty expires its mic stopped working, thats ridiculous with Boat.It also don't have L shaped connector like mi basic earphone, so it's not comfortable while Playing games and connecting to laptop.

 I bought this in October 2020 and writing the review in September 2021. Nearly 1 year of rough use. The sound quality is very good. Amazing noise cancellation. Fits snuggly in my ears. Since it's orange, I can find it when I forget where I kept them. But slowly wear and tears appeared. I have kept it working with cellotapes. Is it worth the money when it can fall apart with some rough use? Or are we supposed to use our earphones delicately?Anyway, I recommend it to music lovers. Others can try something cheaper.

Purchased at 399.Absolutely beast at this price range, and it perform even better with Dolby Atmos. Sound is very loud, bass is just what Indians likes. I normally listen it on 70% to 80% Sound. They are very comfortable to wear the wings don't let the earpiece fall.I have used Sony MDR XB55AP its sound is comparable to this Boat handsfree. I mean Punchy Bass and loud noise. I have Used a range of handsfree from Samsung AKG, Senheizer, Noise, Sony, Motorola, JBL & Philips. In all of these the Bass was main concern except the Sony one and none of them come at this price range.So if you are looking for a cheap handsfree with powerful Bass, punchy sound, crystal clear Voice with noise cancelation, mic and also multi function button with Volume rocker. I would say Go for it.It works with all smartphone that support 3.5mm jack and yes It has zero lag for Game sound like PUBG and COD. So it's also good for playing Battle Royal Games.

Very sharp and thin treble audio and bass is not matching. Very unfit and painful for ear cheap plastic quality design. Artis 400m is much better than this atleas clear vocals and 15mm driver.

My review after 10 days of heavy usage, and I'm comparing it with my previous Realme buds 2.1. sound quality, its good not that bad, but when my friend heard music from my earphones he commented "" Such a Bad Bass "".And even i think it doesn't have good bass2nd Noice Cancellations, uhm maybe it's better than Realme buds 2 in my opinion3rd build quality, I literally liked its build quality, I mean uhm.. I guess wires are really durable and I hope it lasts for a longer than Realme buds 2, my Realme buds 2 lasted for more than a year and was damaged from the button area, wires got damaged and maybe it's because I keep them in my pocket all the time, which reminds me of4. Dude ! The only reason why I really hate these earphones are  its Really, Really, Really Very Uncomfortable even after 10 days, my ears are still Paining... I was thinking about removing the rubber thing but I usually go for running so I need thatAnd it get tangled a lot ( I keep them in my pockets ).The only Reason why I bought this is because 1 year warranty, but honestly I'm regretting I should have really gone for Realme buds 2 they were awesome, Comfortable, good sound quality ( not excellent obviously, but better than these earphone ), and because of those magnetic tips it used to get tangled very Rarely,.If anyone reading this review, wondering about should you buy it or not then... Uhmm... Honestly give Realme buds 2 a try or even if you are purchasing it I hope it doesn't hurt your ear, anyways Good Luck !

It is one of the worst headphones I have ever used in my whole life. I wanted to get one for my calls and some light music and unfortunately fell for the reviews on this product which are a gimmick BTW. The product build quality is quite cheap, worse than those cheap Chinese headphones. They are not at all comfortable for long or even short use because once you put them, it hurts your ears. I had to end up buying another pair of headphones to get rid of these cheap and horrible product. If you are looking for comfort, better music experience for long hours, better go for headphones which are having in ear buds similar to the shape of old Apple earphones. Such in ear headphones which blocks air passing to your ear are neither healthy not comfortable.

The sound quality is just too pathetic.Cons:On call, we or the other person gets to hear echoSound quality seems like a sasta road-side product...too sharp unbearable notes can be heard while listening to online courses or music.The design is just so bad that it causes ear cartilage pain only after listening to 30 mins.Pros:Lookwise is good (but it no where covers up the above nuances)The seller is good. He gave me replace hassle free...but the replacement ear phones STILL has all the above issues. Only the echo issue has somewhat reduced.

Sound quality is good,  bass quality is good too. Lookwise it is stylish and amazing. But this product is not DURABLE.Got it delivered on 30th september and it's hardly 2 months passed that it has stopped working yesterday. Till now I have purchased 5 Nos. of boat earphones. But I am unhappy with the last two purchases. Same issues with the previous one too,  stop working too soon.Initially, for me they use to be the best- better in quality as well as price but not anymore. Varients have increased with time but the quality didn't. Will not recommend anymore.

If you want the best earphones in the price range of 500, go for this one for sure. The bass and the treble are amazing and you can feel it. Also the earclips provided fit and wont come off. Its like they juat glue to your ears and will never come off, unless you remove them. Fits perfectly.Cons- The build quality. It has a cheap Chinese plastic finish on it. My brother had the other black with red on the boat logo. It looked cheap and very bad. But for 399, what can you expect.So my recommendation would be to buy the carbon black one, as it looks much more better and more luxurious. But the price is 549, for the same earphones, of different colours. You get a metallic finish in this one, but you can spot out the plastic easily.Will keep on updating every month till one year, cause boat products last only one year and after that you have to buy a new one.

Im unable to understand wat has to be done to replace the product.. Amazon is also not taking it back.. Please if someone know solution for this please let me know..Product is pretty cool but Very very bad service.

It was just an Awesome sets of earphone with accurate frequency point to listen a song ... Just replacing the ear caps, change the tune & frequency for the listener ...In small pair of ear caps you can hear pure Crystal Clear voice & only it focus on voiceIn medium pair of ear caps u get a sense of Equalize bass, drums, voice (as per song u have/make)In large if it will fit in your ear it will give u complete sense of isolation of song like an large hallIt work like as per a high-Quality headset become sounds as per there change of Padss Cusans ... It's awesome to have it ... Try it u goonna make sure it sense something else in every different ear pads

I bought this product in April 2021. Intially, it worked well but right after 3rd week it started malfunction. The volume from my phone started increasing and decreasing by itself when I moved the wire of the earphone. Also, it stopped working after 2 months. I filed a complaint to boat, they exchanged it with the same orange earphone. The new one did the same, followed the same pattern for two months then stopped working. I exchange again and same thing happened again. This time, I am exchanging the product for the 5th time and I am kind of sure it will be repeated this time too.I think the problem is only in this orange variant because I have the same earphone model in green colour and it works well.  BTW, on my experience boat products in general do not last more than 6 months. I would recommend you to choose a different brand and if you buy this product atleast do not choose orange colour.

Update : stopped working after 1.4  years .. even after utmost care ..I've only used this earphones indoors and never took them out of my house now I've ever tangled it .. still it stopped working ..Writing this after 6 months of usage... Straight to the point I'd like to say isPreviously I was using mi earphones compared to that , these one have very low bass, if you're a bass lover then don't go for it, but boat bassheads 242 has a crisp and clear audio .. the quality of audio is really clearer but there's very little bass and high amount of treble.. you can see even after 6 months of usage the quality of earphone are as it was when I purchased, build quality is really really amazing.. loved it 🙌🙌

This is my review after using a month.Pros:- Easy fit- Good sound- Pretty good Noise cancellation- Provided a small clip to pin the wire to your shirt.Cons:- Can hear non stop for 40 minutes or a hour. then you can get slightly feel the pain. pain is good becasue it will notify to take rest for sometime :)Even though seller mentioned it is waterproof. but still i'm taking care of it by staying away from water and wiping the sweat often.You should buy it without second thought... Happy Purchase!

Just got this after 1 day ( 1-01-2021), and i can say the quality of the earbuds isn't that great because it feels super plasticky, sound quality on the other hand is one of the best I've heard in this price, i also use realme buds2 and the sound is clearly better and clearer in this one, i listen to loads of EDM so this is on the same level or better than RealMe buds 2 in the bass department.Also the earplugs for extra fitting can be removed, i personally find them irritating so thank god for that, so far so good & will update in the future (Update 8-06-2021, left earpiece has stopped working, i never used it harshly but still it stopped working, it's been happening with every earphone i buy, max use time is 5-7 months)

The Mic of this headphone did not work when I checked it wasn't returnable, when I went to claim warranty they asked me to come in the morning.In morning they said they don't have stock!  Visited 4 times to service centre in 4 months and i am still stuck with faulty headphones. Please avoid they are here to dupe you, their conduct at the service centre was exactly that. ( the service centre is in Mumbai )

For the price it is definitely a steal. It is light weight and easy to carry around. The color and design is also quite nice. The bass is exceptionally good.However on the flip side there's a bit of static that is very faint at times when you plug it to your phone. Songs that have bass notes sound amazing but any song that doesn't have a heavy bass, sounds pretty off, making the listening experience unpleasant. Songs that have a stronger degree  of treble will sound shrill in your ear. Nonetheless, for the price it is a good bargain.

Bough this and replaced it once, both times the jack was faulty. It rapidly detoriated within 10days of light usage(only at night fr an hour or so) to the point that it used to ring in one side only in most positions of the jack(started with rarely being so, n within 10days became like this). Replacement had the same story. Before this i used to own a boat 225/220 and worked for 2yrs before one side gave out. Returnd the replacement and bought boat bassheads 225/220 and it works perfectly like before.DO NOT WASTE TIME ON THIS MODEL!Go for boat bassheads 220/225(amazon n flipkart show differebt number for same model) its much better in sound quality, material n durability.

I received a defective product.Headphones jack cover was easily removable.I had attached it with my mobile and later on when tried to take it out cover was coming out.Images are the proofIf brand new headphones have such quality then how will we trust on Boat as brand.I have got Boat Avante 1160 speakerBoat bass head 800 over the ear headphones buy they are good. No problem with them.Realme buds 2 are better than Boat basshead 242 at price of 599 and have magnetic attachment for headphonesHowever whenever I buy a headphone with cable it also have low sound quality or it comes damaged to me.Earlier as well I have returned another headphone which got good reviews from other people who have bought it however it is not the same case with me.Kindly refund the amount so that I can go for other brand.Cable quality is good but final product doesn't seem to have gone from proper checking.Bass is not that good if compared with Realme buds 2

I don't know why everyone is hating this product.  In my opinion it's details are as follows-Pros- 1. It comes with hook that is very good to manage earphone.2. Earphone pouch is pretty decent.3. Earphone fits perfectly in ear without any chance of dropping.4. Sound quality is very good, It's not for very high bass lover, for in my opinion sound is perfectly tuned with treble and bass.5. Ear tips are very comfirtable.Cons- 1. Product quality at this price range is worse. I mean wire quality is very cheap. If you are using it very roughly then it will not last long. REALME BUDS 2 are better then it.2. For bass lover, plz go for REALME BUDS 2, which is best product under 1000.3. There is no noise cancellation, which is not even available in other earphones. So it is not a big issue.That's it. I used almost all earphone. But this is good enough and real me buds 2 is best product to buy.

Sound quality is ear deafening... u can use it with 70-80% more than that u cant ..or u r crazy ...BASS 5/5I feel the price is affordable.5/5The wire are very durable 5/5(Wires with nylon outer cover as of i know )the buttons 5/5I use it as a daily driver in gymit wont come unless u take it out.Cons: After using it for 60-70 minutes you will feel slight discomfort due to the ear wing and also you feel discomfort whiling using it in while on a pillow in bed.( the ear hooks are detachable) it gives more comfort.but it is the best wired headset in the range and it is better than their own 225 headphones...i highly recommend it for people who need A good bass headphones

Bassheads are pretty good at comfort and style💖... It has got a really crispy sound🔊... Ear budds are usefull and clip as well... Perfect for jogging and morning fitness...I found a small demerit--it's mic is a bit unsatisfying, the recording sounds need to be little more clear... When we do phone calls the person on the other line feels some discomfort in hearing our voice...After all.. boAt have made a nice piece of sound... Well done boAt and amazon👍🏼👍🏼💖💖

I have purchased the product after reading the review but sorry to say this product has not at allnfull filled my expectaion at all if i compair it from other priducts like jbl and other iternationl brands. The ear buds dosnot fullybenters in the ear so other sound can be hurd easily if onenis listening any mobile content. As an Indian company I will give 3 star rating. Qyality make 5*, wire jack, clip ,Mic 5star. Volume up and down 2 star only. Max volume 2star. Wire lenghth 3 star. This priduct does not desrev any 5 star ratings. A lot of videonreviews are avaialabale at youtube before purchasing it one must see those reviews at youtube.

I'm telling you with my experience with more than 5 boat earphones, speakers. They compromise on build quality and R&D. Mesh in 3 of my earphones came out. They just use glue to stick which is cheap quality. Wire quality is poor. I understood that boat only focuses on advertising and selling multiple products instead of one good product. Mark this helpful if you think new buyers of boat should be aware of this.

This earphone comes with great features and good quality. Wires are of good quality, nice bass quality, best in this price band of 399 INR, comes with the bonus feature of exclusive buttons for volume up - down rocker, play - pause music buttons. Sound quality is really good and volume level is sure high. Mic quality is not good at least in normal usage. Otherwise it is a value for money earphone.Update: Boat service is excellent. Once registered on their website, they pick up at doorstep and send replacement in 1-2 days to doorstep along with complete tracking info through message, mail and tracking link. Thanks to Boat for their great care and support!

In the first 4-5 months they will work perfectly and you think you cannot get such sound quality at this price. But after 6 months they started to give  a constant ""husss"" sound. After one more month it was unable to play some notes well (sound distorts while playing some notes).I have to emphasize here that the earphones were very well treated - no major bends etc in the wire - no wear on the product itself. But they will fail after 6-8 months.My previous boat earphones were boat bassheads 200 and some other bassheads in the rs500-600 category. Each of the product failed within 12 months - some failed earlier. My conclusion is that these guys spend money in tuning (Bass good) and celebrity promotions of their products compared to the actual quality of drivers which is the poorest. So after 3 failed products within the warranty I am not going to bother purchasing another boat product again.

The wire feels robust but it is not tangle free. Some reasons sound was good but later I start hearing a sharp hissing sound like when you say 'this' you will hear thisssssssssss. Very sharp which actually hit me in my brain. I have noticed this in other Boat earphones as well. Secondly, you can't wear it for a long time. Your ear will start hurting by the earphone. Well, I'm going to waste this earphone because I can stand this hissssssssing sound.  This is my honestly, review and it is really upto you to decide what you want to buy.

So today I got the replaced piece, from the one delivered first, there was a disturbance with movement of the wire, which also means that the earphones won't probably last too long. But the real problem was during calls, the people on the other end complained of a disturbing noise which keeps going on and off. Even with the new ones I got today, if I just rotate the 3.5 mm connector, I can hear some little disturbance which means I might face the same problem probably with these as well but I am not going through the pain of replacing these again, also to be fair I need to test these new ones a little more.The sound quality otherwise is decent, sound a bit too high I think, like 50% is good enough for me and 70-75% is too high and 100% is just not bearable for more than a second!As I said earlier, these are OK, you can buy these and you might be satisfied, but you can also look for other options in this price range.

It has volume button as well as play, pause button3. it has got 3 ear tips for your convenience.4. It also has clip and holder for ear5. It has ipx4 ratingCons1. The play pause button sometimes act as next button sometimes work as play pause confusing mechanism2. It holds perfect but i didn't use that white colour holder if you use that you may feel pain after long time.3. I have used it for gaming continuously for long time but i did gave any issue but i have used it for my online training for one day i had pain in my ears i don't know why.4.

I have I used other boat products and was a happy customer until now. The sound quality is not bad but most likely you will not have a strong connection because of the 3.5mm jack is so slim it tends to come out all the time never stays in place if you have phone back over which we are likely to have. Major flaw in their design don't know if it's cost cutting or some failure to implement sleek design but it makes my purchase useless. Disgrace

I was glad to buy boat earphones supporting Made in India, but the product did not reached my expectationsThere are many cons like1. Rubber earsfit are not soft and is available only in large size. It does hurts for small eared people. Either discontinue giving them along or provide them in every size.2. Drivers are 10mm still bass is far beyond expectations, it does not have punchy base. Can produce pro level wave vibrations.Pros:1. Design is attractive and appealing Colors.2. Water resistant3. Built Quality is good and cables doesn't tangle.4. Carrying pouch is attractive.I suggest boat to remake them around 1k or near and provide good accessories and balance Treble and bass. It's competitors like Wooky, Infinity, JBL & Skullcandy are really heart winning.Boat Baseheads 225 are in a way awesome like other competatives but they are heavy so is avoided.I wish boat a great future ahead.

Quality is not up to the mark. Used with my moto one power as well as HP elitebook . Very uncomfortable noises . Sometimes hessy unwanted noises . Not very comfortable in fittings too.Now I need to buy boat 225 . I had it before and much better than this one .Only plus point is volume control and start stop option. This is working fine.I need to refund money and go for another product but only return option is available. I already returned one product but same problem in returned product.Bab buy.. I need refund of money and go for another boat product.

Awesome earphones!Loved every bit of it except one which I will come on to.The ear buds are great quality plastic doesn't feel like its a sub 500 bucks earphone. The rubber tips are smooth and do not hurt the ears. Base quality is awesome being Boat. Wont go to technicalities, many have written about it.Put on the earphones, pump up the volume to say 60-70% and you are liberated from most of the noises around you including your mom or wife calling you! ;)It has a nice inline mic on right earphone wire and has volume control buttons too on it and all of it is very well built. No build quality complains as such. It is totally worth, very lightweight too on ears and keep wearing this and work/play games/listen to music/do light exercises and what not. They do not slip off with any of that, not sure with heavy workouts. Sweat proof protection too! Aur kya chahiye? batata hun ....Now coming to the one con -It has a straight jack and not a L shaped one. So if you have your headset jack in the bottom of your phone and want to keep the phone upright on your say belly and do facebook/twitter or any other similar app which calls for keeping phone upright then that will get uncomfortable and it straightway will effect the durability as the cable will snap sometime if not soon if you press it against your body and keep doing that.So for that, I am really disappointed with what could have been a real winner! If you have the headset jack at top of your phone - damn lucky you are, blindly go for this headset!!

Wasted 500 for this. I'd rather buy mi earphones worth 300 which at least last longer, have better qualuity and does the job.  Only after a few weeks, i don't like this. I don't think it is gonna last any longer. The mesh literally came out with hardly any force. Very bad quality. Even the ear cap where the brand logo is present came out easily. Had to use feviqwik to stick it. Overall very bad quality for its price. Expected better from boat. The sound quality was good. Noise cancellation was decent.

Bass, amazing.Sound, really good.Looks, AMAZING.Probably one of my best buys after my Bluetooth earphones broke.One should alwaysss go for earphones by Boat, and esp these because they're literally hassle free (charging the bluetooth ones is a pain) and gives you a good feeling just by looking at it.Got them in blue and they're so pretty omg.For the sound quality, it's amazing too. It's been two weeks that I'm using it and there's no pain in the ear as such, claimed by other reviews.(Obviously one's got to have an earpain if you don't give your ears, a chance to breathe and stuff them with headphones/earphones for the most part of the day, right?)Don't have doubts and scones, just go for it.

It's around a month that I am using this product. Sound quality is extremely good. I was using realme buds2 before this for about 2 years. I think this is better than that as per the sound quality is concerned. Very clear sound. Though the wire from the mic to the earplugs are thin as compared to realme buds2 but they are reliable. The extra rubber make it very sturdy and keeps it fixed to the ears and are detachable too. So you can remove them if you want. I have read in some reviews that they cause pain to ears but it's not true. It is very comfortable. If you are thinking for purchasing this then don't give a second thought. Go for it. Would definitely recommend this.
"

I know.. like all these wires and all can be messy but this one look really cool. I got this lime colour and it's more like neon green vibrant colour & I loved it at once. Earplugs are comfortable coz I am wearing them for an hour now and they don't hurt at all, sound is crisp and clear and bass in music just rocks(tried playing variants) .this has this clip,in that way the earplug wires won't be dangling and strangling. I like these volume controls along with the mic and both,  mic and controls works fine. This one is a stretch resistance and I can see why , and hope it tolerates my rough usage. It also comes with a small pouch were I can keep my earphone and make sure it travels safely with me everywhere.😊

The product is an above average one and an advantage to the fame of BOATPros:- It has great brand package- Stylish design and best quality wires that can withstand all kinds of wear and tear- Best class noise cancellation- Sound quality is brilliant and provides above average bass.Cons:- The length of the wire/ cord is too much, so some may feel it uncomfortable as I do- The bass quality is not of the best quality, but on enabling the Dolby Atmos mode on certain mobile phones, it gets to the best version- The buttons may get pressed inwards/ damaged fast, but currently in good conditionOn the whole, go for it. Nice value for money product.

I've used a lot of earphones / head phones. Wired, Wireless.. Top brands like Senheisser, JBL, Samsung and Sony. I have even tried other wired in-ear earphones from boat. None of them are as reliable as this and the key factor here is comfort. Extremely comfortable and causes no pain.

These boat bassheads are an absolute steal for this price.I mainly purchased it for the mic,as it's closer unlike many other earphones and it's fulfilled it's purpose.They have a sporty look and a plastic build.The audio quality is outstanding ,and this is by far the best earphones I've had till now.The bass is punchy and the mistimes are well balanced as well.The noise cancellation on this is unreal.They're great for my workouts and sweatproof.Call quality is great and I've had no complains so far.Overall very satisfied with my purchase.Its sporty look might not be for everyone but performance wise it's great.

Dissatisfied.Firstly, what does bass head even mean? The earphones kept vibrating which seemed some part was detached inside the earphones.The jack pin kept losing contact which made the sound come and go in the right ear with some distortion.The extra ear buds were packed in a flimsy plastic zip lock bag used for medicines. Out of two extra pairs one ear bud was missing. Bring back the manufacturing to India!

Heard alot about this product but actually not satisfied, I would not recommend this for song lover, product hardware quality is good it's durable but the actual work is listening to music which is not good at all, I will give 1/5 for sound quality and 4/5 for durability of product.Another surprising is no return policy. You can exchange but NO RETURN.So order it with cautious

For all those reading the review and scrolling through to find honest ones, I have had the most pathetic experience with the company, the earphones came in working condition but after a few days the mic stopped working and I visited the service centre to get a new one, after a few days even the replaced one stopped working and frustrated I wrote at info@imaginemarketingindia.com, they were good enough to arrange a pick up from my home location and drop off for the 2nd replacement but seems there is no one professional in the company to brief the customer that a pick has been arranged or even the delivery guy with the complete address of the customer. This ain't enough that even the 3rd earphone went bad ie mic stopped working, I again wrote a mail to at the same address and tried to find out email of the management, again there was a pick up arranged with no communication to me or the courier company about my detailed address which again wasted my and the courier guy's time. They have a customer care number which somehow doesn't connect to a representative. I have no clue, but nobody from the company even writing an email just shows how unprofessional they can be, and I bet seems spooky and eerie has hell that is it humans or ghosts running the company. To top it, they are a billion dollar plus company with some 500+ employees. HENCE IF YOU HAVE THE PATIENCE AND MENTAL STRENGTH TO DEAL WITH THE COMPANY FOR WARRANTY, GO AHEAD AND BUY THEIR PRODUCTS AT YOUR OWN RISK.

I recently bought a pair of these amazing  earphones. The product amazed me even before I got it. Firstly, it was delivered to me in less than a day which was too good. Once I received them I was very pleased with their quality. They are noise-cancellation enabled & also have an in-built mike. & to top it all, they come at a very pocket friendly price.

Got the product delivered today. It's just an average earphone. The sound quality is good and also plugs into the ears just perfectly, thus cancelling outside sounds totally. The wire is quite long but is not tangle resistant. Gets tangled very easily. The multi function button works only for calls i.e to pick or cut calls and control call volume. It does not work while playing video or music (though it displays paly/pause symbol). But I got it for 449/- , so for this price I guess it's fine and serves my purpose. So not returning it. It also comes with 2 pairs of extra ear buds and a small carry pouch.

Amazon Packaging - Packaging was good, the package was not destroyed or daformed in anyways, package was water tight (I know as it was raining 🤔)....Coming to the product package, the colour I chose was the same as shown on preview, comes with a warranty card, manual, two pairs of extra buds (1 small, 1, big) and a sticker.I am using the product for 2 months now, no change in colour or any damage to the microphone wherever, well if it is used roughly, it won't last a year.... Used carefully, it would clearly last 2-4 yearsBass boost is a 4* as can't hear at 85+ volume, noice cancellation is a go, I use it for my classes for 5-6 hours a day straight and it feels good ...But, the ear adjust earpiece hurts after using 3 hours straight so I have to use the product without the earpiece, but it's good for a call or a movie....Totally Can't Complain as this is totally cheap and the best quality avilable till now...(Couldn't share picture because of a glitch)

I don't know if you are an audiophile or not but as far as I am concerned these are the one of the best high-quality stuff available online.though the sound is not as par as a 3k headphone, what do you expect in such a small price range?pros:* good fit perfect ear support* awesome colour* mic is also good* the jack is hard to pull as no ridges on it if hands are oilycons:* not tangle-free* dirt magnet* no velcro and case to keep safe* the pinch too big and ugly* lacks bass and the sound is high pitched

I use it daily and it is excellent in this price.Bass isn't that strong. Good thing I don't rely on bass that much, simple vocals are enough for me.Design is good just the jack should have been angled not straight. If not careful, it can get damaged.Ear buds are not comfortable when those circle decoration things are on. They are easily removable. Less decorative then I guess.It came with a pouch and not a bad one.

I am disappointed. I recieved earphones with a malfunction. The sound quality is very good, crisp and clear. The mic is working fine. The bass is decent but not as good as I thought after reading the reviews. The malfunction is in the 3D sound. The sound that should come from left earphone come from right earphone and the sound that should come from right earphone comes from left side. You can notice this only if you play BattleGrounds Mobile India using the earphones. If you want to check your earphones then search on Youtube- ""footesteps in Pubg"" the first video of Gaming with Leo channel can help you checking this error. I played it for many days first I thought the problem is in the game but that's not the case. My earphones are faulty. I claimed warranty by calling a number given on the warranty card to activate warranty. Then I registered a complaint them on mail as (e-mail mentioned on warranty card as well as contact no. And website to register complaint). It is my first earphone purchase from boat company and I am disappointed. I am regretting why I skipped buying realme buds 2 just to save some money. Now I am waiting for replacement and they say it may take maximum 20 days to complete the replacement procedure and that too after they check my earphones that if it's faulty or not.

Good quality, bass, treble, volume, noise cancellation ( not sure about noice cancellation while on road but I think you can still go for it if you want to use high volume, it does it's job) I don't use earphone while talking so I can't review on it. Doesn't tangle (a plus point on that). Clear sound with a good amount of bass. I'm satisfied with this product.

After using it for a month or two.. Let me figure this out for you1) Sound quality upto the mark2) Bass is balanced which i prefer neither too much or less3) Built quality and the extraa layering over the wire makes it more reliable.4) Unconventional plugs makes it glew to the ear drums pretty well.5) Comes with a warranty6) Price range is perfect for a colored headphones like these.The only thing they can do better is with the microphone and volume balance. sometimes its too low or too high but hey it could be a case with the phone I am using.

this was my first boat earphones after a lot of research/reviews.... every headphone brand has their own signature sound. Personally I like signature sound of philips. Although, I'd not tried many earphones but i found these boat 242 bassheads are unnecessarily noisy, again it's my personal point of view, as I like quality voice with good bass, but in these earphones I found vocals are distorting and getting  worse after 50% of volume. It becomes very irritating to ears & for bass lovers who want to hear boom boom more, these earphones are bassy but distorting & loud vocals make it worse experience. I think boat tried to satisfy critics after bassheads 225 by exploring other aspects of music other than bass in this price range but I personally didn't liked it, unnecessarily loud. I am giving it 2 stars just for bass & points deducted as bass is overlapped by distorting, irritating treble.

Boat has personally been my Favourite Company for Buying Gadgets & Accessories. My trust on this Brand is immense and I have most of my Electronic Gadgets & Accessories from Boat.So, comes this Earphone which I have bought it for the Second Time without even Browsing other Options from other Brands.

Perfect Length of the Wire, Snap Clip to attach it to your Top Wear3.

This headphones are best in this price ,good sound quality, noise cancellation, good grip on ear while exercising but it might have some flaws like you have to put mic very near to lips then it's sound deliver perfectly on other side , sound quality is good but too best compare to high brand headphones.Overall go for it. It just have mic isse and little sound delivery.

Earphones look good.Sound is good. Mic is good.Bass is not good, listen to a normal bass song (not bass boosted ones), it has less bass. I compared it with Sony MDR Ex155AP and felt day and night difference. So did not enjoy music in this headphone. Music is more on treble side.Bottom-line:- if you love bass, this is not the earphone.

Now I can review this boAt Bassheads 242 in-Ear Wired Earphones with Mic. because I have been using it since last year, now I completed one year of my experience with this earphonethere are 10mm divers in this earphone which creates heavy bass.and the bass of this earphone is such a great of this segmentbut the vocal is good but not so clear as it should be.and if we are talking about it treble is better than other earphones in this price segment.Now let's talk about the pros and cons of this earphonepros1 this wire quality is so good because it has tangle free cable2 the mic quality is better for calling than the other earphone3 there is a volume controller on the right side of the earbuds4 this earphone has a wire clip inside the box carry pouch as well5 sound quality, the sound quality is not bad, it has a good quality sound experiencecons1  I couldn't find any cons of this earphone

Sound quality: 5/5....this is the best sound an earphone can provide u in this price range...the best...from the amount of bass to the clarity of audio...its perfect in all terms.Comfort: 4.5/5...tho the hooks are provided for extra grip but they irritate my ears and dont fjt properly...idk if its just me but i didnt find the design very comfortable...also the earpieces are soo light in weight...maybe its a plus point for y'all but i didnt like them so light in weight.

I've bought multiple earphone from bought and these are the first ones to disappoint me. My primary use for them was to use it as a media player for music which it does so I haven't returned it.On the other hand, it does not play or pick up on audio when I receive calls, I have to manually remove the earphones to hear the other person. I don't know if it's my piece tahts faulty or this model has this feature. Either way, it's a terrible receiver when it comes to calls.

Very good sound for priceEarHooks are soft and fits/ feels nice and can be detachedEarphone tips are angled..so right earphone fits right ear and...Volume control works fineLastly/ Sadly, Non-braided cable so it feels kinda flimsy and not so durable always knotting so always need untying before useIf you looking for quality earphones costing less that Rs500; just go for Boat.

Build quality was ok. Initially bass was okish. But after audio tuning it felt great. Buttons functioning were gud. Might feel pain in ears if using for long tym due to ""secure ear lock"" not coz of ear piece.Absence of Gold coated Jack felt a bit down.Overall, a totally value for money product at such price point and a real steal deal offer ;-)

the material quality of the headphone is good one . the MIC works well . And this headphone is best suits to the people who loves bass music . and it is good for gaming too. but the audio quality is quite depressing . very different experience from the ear phone I used before .This is the. Review what Iam writing after four months ( below) .The left side of the earphone stops working  , I don't know why . So if you are using this earphone . Handle with care  , it might stop working one day .

I didnt personally like it sound quality, mids and lows and even bass is very much average. Tried it for music, movies but not satisfactory on pubg the performace is way too bad as the noise is too high. I was using an mi headphones and they where far better than these. Not at all good for long users...  This is my realistic review after about 2 months of usage

It is a good earphone, fits in ear perfectly, a little big, but I don't know why people says it is better than realms buds 2. The sound is way much better in buds 2 . Buds 2 sound has much more bass feels much alive than this boat basshead 242. I suggest you to to buy buds 2 anytime over this. Realms buds 2 has no competition in this price range. But if you want an earphone while doing exercises and running buy this boat basshead 242 . It is sweatproof and doesn't fall of from your ear easily .

It's below average product. Bass quality is not good. Sound cracks at high volume. Almost little or No noise cancellation. And the most irritating thing is the cord, which gets tangled and has an unusual elastic property...You can't straighten the cord. It will automatically comes back...Like a spring. Mic is average. Sometimes couldn't hear the other person during call. Overall below average chinese made product.

Please dont buy this product. To know why just read the review :-I purchased this on 21st December 2020 and it stopped working Today on 12th May 2021. Within 5 months, one side of the earphone stopped working without any damage. Edit - Today on 25th the second side also stopped working. I am trying to contact Boat and Amazon for help but their is a lot of delay in the name of Lockdown. Boat is not ever considering this issue because they are not replying my mails, calls or anything. Amazon will not help you much on this like befor, I don't know why. One more thing - the colour starts going away in few days of use. It may look old or low quality product in a months or 2.

I have used boat 400 earphone and it was awesome. This one may be stylish but its waste of money. Left side stopped working within a month with minimal use. No near by boat centre to replace or repair. I bought 2 similar headphone and both ended up being useless within a month. Prefer other item of boat not this.

Received original product. Audio quality is nice but it doesn't have much noise cancellation. Within 6 months the mike and the jack part of the earphone stopped working but it was under warranty so I sent it back for repair and they took 1 month for it so I have to buy another pair  . I received the repaired earphones and they are working fine now but 1 month for repair is really long time. Please vote'helpful review'if it helped you.

At first, I was sceptical about these earphones because these are very low cost for the features they offer. I was doubtful that the sound output might not be that great out of these earphones. But suprisingly these are exceptional earphones because of the fact that these have great sound output with features like splash resistant, have great noise cancellation, multimedia control buttons, mic, Nylon coated cables, and very reasonable price tag.Compared to the expensive rival brands like JBL and Sennheiser, these offer more value.I bought these mainly to be used for workout sessions but now these are my primary earphones for all types of media consumption. Sound output like Highs (treble) and Mids (voice) are very well balanced and has punchy low end (bass).Although at start one may feel that these earphones are a bit uncomfortable during long hours but with time one will get used to them easily.The only down side I feel about these earphones is that they have cheaper plastic feel to it. But considering the pricing you can not expect more. Although the plastic is sturdy enough if you use them carefully.

I am a very old fan of boat. I have almost 7/8 earphones including headphones as well from boat. Some I used for myself some I gifted to family members. But we are a Boat family now.Ita worth buying. Best sound quality. Just sometimes person on the other side hears less voice of yours during call using microphone. Elee it's great all time. Would recommend you to go for it.

Support given with it for fixing in ear is extremely painful in ear. Ear start paining after 10 to 15 minutes. So you cannot wear it for long time. This is major major draw back.

You must try. So the packing and delivery was good . Other then this the product is awesome as per budget . I bought one earphone with gurantee but the wire torned and automatically seprated from the buds . And only 2 months I think I have used that and the cost was 300. Then I bought this and either it's not long time but it's very handy, soft wire, good sound and speakers hold and mic is also good . I am not very Cary for earphones and also I bought this kind of buds first time and I am completely satisfied .

It says it is designed for fitness enthusiasts and water resistant but I feel it's just a marketing strategy.I used it only ones while running and the next moment it stopped working.Worst part is the customer service. I went to Borivali center with the product, forget about the solution they didn't even register my complaint. They asked me to come back whenever the product is available. And its been months now they don't have product available and the solution according to them is to visit another service center which is in very far from my place.In short it's customer who have to suffer for the worst customer service and for buying such disgusting Brand product.

Amazing Fit which I will rate as 9 out of 10 and Amazing Sound Quality of 9.9 out of 10 because there is always a scope for improvement in the sound quality. The bass is just fine and not overused which is a very good point but it might be deal breaker for some. The Button Functions are not so cool as they appear but they work just as fine, Mic is perfect and the extra earbuds provides a wide ranging satisfying experience as per your use and fit.Overall a decent and stylish product with  addons of a fine quality carry  pouch and a clip of satisfying material. You will love this product.

After use of 1 month....-Initially the sound is soooo amazing... You gonna love the earphones but after use of few days bass starts fading (don't know the appropriate word)- starting few days it gives you clear sound with clear bass but after a month or 2 months... It start giving you noisy sound.How i compare?I bought 2 products 1 from Amazon and 1 from boat website and after a month i open the brand new package i ordered from boat and anyone can feel the difference.So this product is good but not durable.

The High and Mids (Treble) are crystal clear. Lyrics can be distinguished. The lows(bass) are not that thumpy as they should be. Even with an equalizer the bass is not crispy, you can just feel a little not enjoy. Bass:- 3/5Overall:- Affordable at 449, comes with extra buds, wires look durable(will update after month use), volume button works well

I've been using these earphones for 4 months now and these are working pretty well. It has built in alexa which is a great feature and works perfectly fine. Boat never disappoints its customers when it comes to quality and since I'm a regular user that's why I can say this. But I've faced issues with wireless earphones from Boat (they get disconnected in between). I got them for ₹449 and i guess that's the min price they offer.Build quality ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Sound quality ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Alexa⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Easy to carry⭐⭐⭐⭐Noise cancellation ⭐⭐⭐Case is a bit small, so it's difficult to keep them inside easliy⭐⭐Overall at the price of ₹449 ⭐⭐⭐⭐Hope this helps ! ✅

After years of using earphones from other brands (which always costed me more), I came across and bought this pair from boat. Special thanks to Amazon for quick delivery.I got the earphones for INR 499, and am quite pleasantly surprised and delighted by the set of features these earphones offer. You get excellent bass and sound quality (better than other brands in my experience in this price range), volume control buttons (which I didn't expect at this price :)), play-pause-call button, a clip to ease the hands-free experience, durable and thicker wires, and sturdy earphone casing. This seems to be specially designed to withstand wear and tear during regular usage. The buds also have small and comfortable hook shaped grips that firmly keep the buds in place when you are running. It also comes with a small pouch to help you carry them easily. So much at this price, it's really an excellent product at this price that offers good perks along with a great sound quality.

Good earphones and worth purchasing a second one. The earphone wire quality is also fine and there is no problem, of any sort since beginning.Noise cancellation is also satisfactory however,  in this time of lockdown since unable to move out in open so cannot test it on moving ground. But when there is lots of noise of other equipment at home then these  headphones cancel noise satisfactorily.

Always there are some wired hanging on you.2. Some times its giving pain to ear.

I have bought this earphone 5 times and all of them gave me one common problem after 5-6 month of usage, any one side would stop working.

I ordered these earphones after using boAt bassheads 225 and have been using these earphones since two months and i thought i should write a reviewFirst time when i ordered (2 pairs, one for me and the other for my brother) , BOTH WERE DEFECTIVE ! Ordered again with a successful refund and using them since till datePros:--Very good sound quality-Very comfortable on ears and you can use them as long as you want without pain in the ears-Extreme bass , bass lovers like me would love this-Very good noise cancellationCons:--These earphones get tangled very easily and the anti-tangle claim is false-It is very likely that you would get a defective product so check for it . My one of the earphones had no sound on the left earplug and the second earphones had inverted right and left. Check for all these defects as soon as you get these earphones-the pin is straight unlike the 225 so the wire gets turned at a 90 degree angle which can result in breakning of the wire in the long runConclusion- Sound quality is really great and these earphones are really comfortable , you might get defective piece so check for that. Its a great deal although there's just a feeling i get that these earphones are not good for the longer run. Would update ya'll if they stop working.

Its audio quality is highly addictive  especially when i listen Skechers . Just go for it .

I like the earphone. Sound quality is good . Bass is ok. Wire quality is average.But listening song on higher volume really hurts the ear so i will recommend not to use it on higher volume.

Really loved the product right from out of the delivery cover😅 packing of boat was always unique and stylish when got into it it was really surprising as i was just expecting earphones with spare of earbuds but this company really is a standout from all of the brands it even gave a small pouch for earphones and a branding sticker. Which kept more than satisfied for the price range of 449. When all of other brands are concentrating on just package this stoodout by thinking from customer point of view what exactly will be useful.After plugging the jack my 1st expression was 😳😲😯 wooow just woow nothing else. 😄😄

I decided to go for this product based on the good reviews i saw.But to say the truth i am disappointed by this purchase.During first time usage of the product ,it impressed me a lot but as i started to use it for calls i saw its real color.It had a buzzing sound in the background while attending calls.This buzzing sound increased as days past.I have returned this product.Moral-Dont go blind over the good reviews

I found the sound and especially the bass to be great. Lived upto its claim of a ""bassHead"". Sound 5. What I found bad, is the earhook gives a stinging pain in the outer ear and its really annoying. Its not something I could bear, that annoying. With that said, maybe I got used to it a bit (considering I was using over-the-ear headphones for a long while and rarely used in-ear ) and I also switched the small ear-tip to the fat-tip that they provide, and I can almost give it a 4 star review. really if sound is all you care about, get the basshead 220 or something. But the product looks good, sounds great, even for gaming I cant complain, and is uncomfortable if you are not suited to in-ear styled earphones. Feels sturdy too, hopefully lasts a good while. overall a 4 star, not bad.

First of all I am true fan of boAt. This product was my 3rd purchase. Coming precisely to the point. The sound i experienced in this earphone was not natural as i expected, when i firstly heard audio from it, the word that came in my mind was ""Electronic, it sounds like metal instrument being played in my ears"", meaning that there was no naturality. Too much bass making mids awkward, treble was high. After all i retuned immediately and purchased boAt bassheads 100 which sounds much better. I am using 100 from 2 years and i am satisfied with that.Dissappointed with boAt bassheads 242.

Good but feels kind of cheap since my previous earphones were the Sennheiser cx275s. It's been 2 weeks and I  was cleaning the mesh in the earphones and it just got pushed in . I didn't even put  pressure on it . Small things like this really ruin the experience. I found the ear tips provided in the box to be of a cheaper quality and I found that changing them with the silicone ear tips of the Sennheiser cx275s helped make my experience better .

All pros..The only earphones that actually remained in my ear..Good bass.Volume is so ooud, I had to reduce my phone volume to half, whereas previous ones, even Mi had to be put at full volume.I bought it after reading the great reviews.Really worth the money, they also give ear plugs of different sizes

Very good product. Been using it since 6-7 months continuously. Very rough usage (while traveling in Mumbai local). Still its very durable, sound quality is not compromised at all. In 80% volume you won't feel any sound from outside. The rubber whites might be irritating to some but its easily detachable. Very good product in this price range.

It is a fine product, serviceable sound with above average build quality. The cable is a bit fragile, had to get the first one replaced.The wing tips are not comfortable and are not able to stay is place. Prime example of form over function. Also the images in the product discription show the colors to be way brighter than the actual product.Well despite my critisism I have been using them for the past 6 months and they have worked well. Basically you are getting what you paid for.Unfortunately, the moc has stopped working recently. Not sure how the warrenty claim would go. Might change the rating based on the experience.

Boat's ear cord is always been trademark among other earphones. There is no issue in the sound quality, bass quality but little expensive to this price.

Though the sound quality is good, the product is delicate and not built to last.The ear plugs are very soft at the base where it attaches to the earphones and easily comes off by itself if you pull it out of the pocket or a bag.There is no support to the wire where it attaches to the 3.5mm jack. After just one month of use the wire broke from the jack.Over all rating is 1 star as it is useless just after 1 month.My suggestion: Buy one with 'L' shaped jack, they last a lot longer.

Earphones sound good with some emphasis on bass but it's not overpowering. They're lightweight and cable quality is nice.If you crank up your Equalizer and boost the bass, the earphones literally start vibrating on high volumes. The best part is there's no distortion whatsoever, good earphones by boat 👌. They sound much better than my previous mi basic.Only con is on using the earphones for 2+ hours, ears start hurting a bit.It also comes with a clip so that you can wear these to your workouts.Offers a lot for ~500₹ range, can't go wrong with this purchase.Pros-LightweightCan handle strong bassSort of braided cableWing tipsGood sound qualityValue for money ✔️Cons-Maybe cut down on the packaging, lot of paper and plastic wasted

My Review about this earphone :1. Build Quality : 4/5 for its material and snug fitting in the ears and also for the anti tangled wire2. Sound Quality :  Base : 4/5  Voice calling : 3/5  Volume : 3/5 it can make u deaf easily on high volume ( recommend not more than 70% for music)  Noice Cancellation : 5/5 ( suppress external sound upto 90%)  For Gaming(especially BGMI) : 1/5 (not recommended for Gaming. As u can hear nearby sound so hard that you're unable to hear footsteps properly from a certain distance.3. Value for Money : 3/5  For Music : Hell Yeah  For Gaming : Not recommended.

I've been using branded Earphones since year 2000.I used many brands , Sony , Nokia , SoundCore , Samsung , Jabra and many others.I'm not comparing it with premium brands.But according to price , here is what I think.Let's talk about sound quality.Sounds aren't soft i feel this earphones will give you headache if you listen to it for 30 minutes.Instruments sounds aren't clear , and I'm not able to hear many instruments in this earphone.Over-all Sounds feels like very flat , and sounds of this earphones irritates me.Bass is fine fine ( acceptable at this price)But except bass other sounds are very flat.If you need one year warranty and need good call quality then you can go for this one.But if you're looking for better sound quality then this earphone isn't for you.I have tried BoAt products , and i feel BoAt is all about advertisements and show off, actual products are cheap and not worth the amount they're taking.This earphones sounds same as cheap earphones you can buy from local market under 200rs.I don't feel anything special about BoAt ,And this is last product i purchased from BoAt , in future, i won't even think that this brand even Exists.I'm not a hater , but I'm not satisfied as a consumer.And it's my right to give review or feedback to help others.It was my honest review.Thanks

In my opinion, I don't find these earphones that good. For beginners, they can go for it but users like me who use to spend plenty of time listening to music, communicating on discord and gaming. It is not suitable.  After some point, they feel like they stucked in your ear, pain in earlobes and high pitch sound hits like an arrow.Mic input is ok, you get clear sound in quite environment but if you are in noisy environment, they capture all those noise.

Basshead 100 earphone much better than it. Basa quality not good at all. In my view it is a cheating item. I also use basshead100 which is more comfortable than it. I fall in impress by seeing site review, but now feel that only 5/8 preplanned reviews among more than lakhs not saying truth. Hope Amazon take care of it.L

Guys the microphone absolutely sucks! You cannot talk on a call properly with this one because the call receiver cannot hear you at all!The sound quality is good, but a earphone is not only for that right? Its all a hands-free product for your calls! Bad experience for me

Basshead 242 I love this product, also I love to use boAt's products & I used 7or8 product. cause all those good products which I am use really nice & great. And boAt give their all customers the best quality in minimum price range.In this earphone the sound quality is pretty good.Bass is perfect for my opinion, volume up and down bottom & call receiving button is perfectly handy, 3.5 mm jack is not gold-plated but also the Jack is working very nicely.♥️

Amazing product. Value for money.Good built quality and fits properly into the ear.Go for it if you are a bass lover as it has more base and clarity is slighlty in the lower side but did pretty decent job comparing those with prices ranging from ₹1000 to ₹2000.I am really happy with this product, all I can say is that if you are going to buy an earphone under 1500 this is the best you get. Just under 500 and you can never wish an earphone under this price better than this.Update after 6months,mic got complaint and I registered complaint in Boat website, they have given me a replacement directly from the brand itself.

I received the package today. Tried it right away. Here are the things I noticed:-1. Sound quality- bang for the buck2. Bass quality- I'm not much of a basshead but I can say it's really nice.3. Build quality- honestly the last boat earphones I had felt much more of higher build quality,but still they ended up dead in one side after few months of usage. This one is glossy and not much to my liking but does not feel that much cheap too. Cables are braided, the right nd left cable feels braided but is not.4. In the box- I got a pouch, extra tips, a clip to attach the cords.5. Overall experience- good. I'm happy for now. Sound is nice and clear just how I like it. Still I have not tested it with all kinds of music but it gets the job done pretty nicely. Looks are really nice. Best part is the fitting in ear. I had never seen an earphone fit in my ear so nicely without falling out.Will update more after using it for a while.

Bought these earphones after reading all these positive reviews here.  So here's my review:Box contains the earphones, two extra rubber buds, a pouch to carry the earphones, a warranty card, a pamplet showing other boat products and a boat sticker.Coming to earphones itself, the build seems good enough, nothing extra ordinary. The wire from the separtor till the earpieces seems a bit thin. The wires are covered in a nylon outer which gives it a cheap look if I'm being honest.The earphones fit firmly but one might find some discomfort at first because of that rubber horn for sports activities. Wearing and removing the earphones with them is difficult as well. Though it is removable but the earphones look bad without them.Coming to the sound quality, this is where I got a little disappointed. Maybe I was expecting too much but I didn't like the sound output much. The bass is too much boosted that it just kills the other aspects of the song. The treble sounds below average because of the overpowered bass. If you want a overall balanced sound experience then please go with some other earphones. I was using JBL C150si before this and those JBLs are way superior in terms of sound experience.

So I'll be sharing my views about this earphone with you guys. So I'll be summing up my review in total of 3 points i.e. experience ‚ comparison and why you should buy it1) Experience : If I talk about my experience then I'll say that I have been using these boat earphones for 4 months and I haven't faced any issue yet ☺️ .  As the name itself suggests BASSheads they truly offers a very good bass . The mids and lows are also good. They are truly value for money.2) Comparison : As it's price is around 550 I don't think any other big brand provides any earphones in this price segment but if your budget is around 700 then definitely go for the jbl ones3)Why should you buy it : According to me around at a price of 550 they are definitely one of the finest earphones . But one of the major reason why I brought these earphones is because of boAt not just because its a big brand but also of its warranty i.e. boAt provides doorstep return pickup of your earphones in ODISHA I don't know about any other state  So I would say if warranty matters to you a lot then these boAt earphones are definitely for you .Pros1) Braided cable you don't have to worry about your cable anymore like I do 😅2) boAt offers wings which will never let the earphones come out if your ears 😋.3)Stylish and premium looking 😎.4) ipx4 water resistant 😃.5)You can use these earphones while lying on your bed or lounge these won't hurt 😉.Cons1) The earbuds are not metal but plastic 😔Hope my review will help you choose your earphones :-)EDIT after 10 months of usage *slight issues in the left earbuds* will try to claim its warranty lets see

Amazing product. Using it for almost 8 months but still no compromise in sound quality and also bass is superb.But at full volume the sound becomes crispy.but yaa you can use it at 80% volume for good bass and vocals .And also good for gaming.i played pubg .you can hear footsteps easily.Go for it if you are a gamer and good bass lover
"
1182,"
I'm torn between 3 or 4 stars. I'm giving it 4 because it's the best in its range i'd say.But there are downsides, the treble is very weak and the bass is overshadowing everything else. It doesn't produce the clearest of sounds because of this. The ear hooks are very uncomfortable after an hour of use.Buy this if you're on a tight budget, I'd suggest spending 200-300 more and get Sony MDR or Sennheiser CX 180.I wished boat balanced out everything for a better experience rather than going all out on bass. Not the best for pure listening experience because of weak trebles etc.

 Bought this in April 2021 to try new product which has a good bass. Initially it was working good. But after 4 months which the products is not used much, on the right side volume of the headphone volume is very less. Tried to claim the warranty but the service centre is 2 hour away from my place. Would recommend to go for other brand or Philips is the one I am using it works for 2 years easily. Earlier I had bought boat earphones after one year onside of the earphone stopped working which I had used a lot in mumbai local. In short I feel it's not a good product don't waste your money.

This Earphones is only good for EDM, DUBSTEP and Beat lovers.. very less Clarity, Extra Bass Which makes the voicing muffled. I'd recommend you all to use the equaliser to balance the bass.  Look wise is good. Not for rock, metal music lover . . And Most importantly You can't use it for long use.. ears starts hurting after 15-20 mins of use.. I Guess it's because of That extra bass..After a week of use you ears will start hurting a lil bit..Over all OKAY experience..Sound - 3Clarity - 2Look-  4Noise Cancellation - 4Quality - 3.5

1. In first look and hands on, sound quality of it is good and clear(writing this after listening variety of songs in about 2 hours.2. I would say noise cancellation is pretty good in this price segment.3. This boat 242 wired earphone is far more better than my previous 2 boat earphones I. E. Boat 225  and Boat 180 in every aspect.4. Bass quality is superb, I can say this surely because already listen some dj songs, rap songs and normal songs with it and obviously when u watch movies (either it is in ott platform or in ur laptop or desktop) it's crystal clear sound in it.5. I love the most important feature of this earphone is that it has volume rocker switch, so that if anytime in playing games or watching movies or listening to songs or in calling time, u can up or down the volumes.6 Most important - Due to it's clear sound and bass quality u won't need to level up the volumes to 90% when playing games like pubg, codm etc which depends on sounds in all the time. So don't worry game lovers, u can level up the volume just by 60% to 65% ,  in sometime 70%max.  , u can easily hear in game things out clearly.7. The ear hook is good, it won't feel hard when you are using it in long time like 3 hours continuously  or 5 hours. Thumbs up for this #boat .8. Nylon qouting on all the wires is makes this earphone more durable and tangle free.9. Got this in 499RS. , so pretty much it is budget earphone in day to day use.10. I also have 4 more earphones alongside with it like - skullcandy, 2 boat earphones, 1 xiaomi basic earphone(399 RS.) , but from all of it I can surely say that this boat 242 earphone is very good in compare to others that I mentioned.

Pros : Build Quality [not braided but has a protective layer on wires].  Aesthetically Nice.  Quite a good fitting. Fits really well. Do not tend to fall off.  Has a clip to hold the wires together.Cons : Bass on a lower side (may not be good for bass lovers) yet decent.
"

Ok it's descent product. Build quality is good.Sound quality is good for bass lovers. But bass reduces the other small sound effects, but it's ok for regular use. If you are a pro music listener who need every small detail of instruments played then go for some other costly products.

The first preference was entirely because it is na Indian brand.It Fits perfectly, lightweight with above average sound quality. Mic does a decent job too where there is no complaints of distortion from either side.Tangled free breaded cable is a good touch to have along with the 1 year manufacturer warranty. Eartips are very soft and comforting which will ease your prolonged wearing hours.A perfect gift to gift yur loved ones👍🏻❤️

Best earphones for the price. Build quality is great, sound and noise cancellation is also very, very good. Bass comes out nice and crisp. Loud as well. I personally don't like loud music, I enjoy at medium volume levels so it is best for me. Also it has a quite snug fit in the ears so it won't fall off while jogging/workout sessions. Also you get a cute pouch with it. Will update on long term use later.

Do not go for TWS from Boat as they have very less durability and life time. I've bought many tws from Boat and within a year or two all are malfunctioning. Instead this wired earphone is more practical and can last upto same 2 years meanwhile offering better audio quality at a lesser price which will give you lesser depreciation after two years. Mic and audio quality is decent for a regular guy to handle calls and listen to music or stream online content. Good fit with very minimal noise cancellation(I'm ok with it).Best wired earphones in this price range.

I have been using mi earphones from past 2 years and they are surprisingly quite durable and lasting but they didn’t sound so good. So i went for boats this time as i already have boat rockerz 400 and boat is getting more and more better in quality and sound. so its been quite a good time i have been using this and they are pretty good. This are awesome they dont fall out of your ear due to the silicon attachment with it. As it name says bass heads they are actually good with it bass. The audio is crisp and perfect, i would recommend them over bassheads 225. Overall quality is nice and perfect at this price point. If you are looking to get a good pair then give this a shot. You wont regret it

worst experience with the boat this time. I have already used many boat products but this time the earphones are worst of their sound as well as the microphone is even worst. First i thought that it is the network problem. After that everyone is saying same that my voice is cracking and they are hearing the voice like the robot is speaking. I also replaced the product. I thought this was the issue with this product only but the second one is also the same. I don't recommend this product of boat. Instead you can use bassheads 152 that is a good one.

It has been only 10 days since my purchase. It is too early to give a detailed review. Since my purchase I have used the earphone with my POCO mobile to watch videos and to listen songs. I will rate the audio quality to be GOOD among the mid range earphones. I have also used with my Dell laptop, to play strategy games like Northgard, Dota2. These games usually take 2-3 hours straight. I didn't feel anything uncomfortable during long sessions, as I have read from other reviews (may be it is just my personal feelings). But I feel that the earphone jack doesn't fit my laptop socket and so it reduces the audio quality a bit.

My unit started having weird volume imbalance between earpieces within 3 months, and the call button isn't working properly. The unit is original and I've raised a complaint ticket. I didn't expect this from a brand like BoAt, I don't find this product to be reliable.Edit - only a few months later, the replaced unit also stopped working I'm really frustrated with these earphones.

This is a repeat purchase for me. First one is still working very well even today. But this new one's sound is jittery at higher volumes.

Value for money product.Sound quality superb at this priceNoise cancellation is pretty good tooBass quality is one of the best in this price rangeIt is very comfortable when listening music, watching movies/series and also for calling.The positioning of mic is too good,very near to mouth so no issue in mic as well.I personally used this earphones for straight 3-4 hrs without any issue..So I'll give 9.5/10..Definitely a must buy product...I'll recommend it to anyone for 500 or 550 rs... Its worth the money.Adding this part after 17 days of usage.The earphones are really superb. Bass is also awesome and treble and vocals are much better than other earphones at this price range.Only thing a lot of people are complaining about is the ear hooks that starts paining aftet sometime. Well it did happen to me but I figured out that I was putting the hook in a wrong way which was causing pain. But after I corrected the way I can wear it for hours and take calls and watch movies web series easily..And also the carry pouch that is supplied in the box is too handy to carry earphones to avoid any damage and it looks really dope as well.A must buy product if you are looking for earphone at budget of 500.

So I have been using this earphones for like 5 months now so I can say that this earphone is basic good value for money but for the ones who are primarily going to use it music have to stop even I thought this would be very nice after moving from jbl earphones which is gem for hearing music but not this one so if ur primary goal music then I'd say buy the jbl ones much better bass and very good for music and u just want for meeting and other simple works then this is ok and it doesn't last very long if ur a gamer because mine has louse contact issue in just some months this is surely bad😔

earphones are good but its connector (the black thing by holding whom we plug in and out the earphones from phones ) is very slippery. when your phones are plugged in and  if your hands are little oily or watery( like after eating some food or after washing hands) then its not easy to plug out the earphones. ou have to use some cloth to plug out the earphones.The connector  should not be slippery . it should be rigid to hold.Rest earphones sound is clear , base is awesome in price range.

I've been using these earphones for 3 months now and so far there were no issues at all. They fit really well in the ears thus making it perfect for sports. The audio is very clear and the bass quality is amazing. I wouldn't say these earphones are noise cancelling but yes it does control the noise around to some extent. The mic quality is excellent. One more thing I liked about these earphones was that you get a small earphone case in the box. You also get some pictures of your favourite celebrities. Also, I was surprised to see that these budget earphones have volume control buttons! If you were to ask me I would definitely recommend this product. Amazing for the price(549/-).

Here is my experience with the eaphones1. Unboxing : Here it is a bit of cost cutting. The box is not of great quality and the your unboxing experience is not that great2. Build quality : The earphones are well built. We get the three buttons under 500. Definitely will last for 1 year + under moderate care. Wires are also of great quality although they are not braided.3. Sound quality : No compromise here. It's really great. Probably the best sounding experience under 500.4. Others : I am being very blunt. The eartips are very bad. Although they will get your job done. But compare it with the likes of mi and realme. They have way better eartips and it is something you will noticeThe earhooks seemed to me more annoying than useful. We can remove them so it's nothing to worry about.You also get a pouch. It really isn't that great. Like if they were giving they could have given a proper one where earphones could easily be placed.Overall if you could manage to get 100 more, then go for realme buds 2. I have those too and you will not regret.

Need to tell about this in one line, JUST GO FOR IT.. Best headphones ever under this price segment. Quality of the headphone was good and also the sound quality too good. Bass and noise cancellation were little bit low, means out of 10 I'll give 8 for bass and noise cancellation and 9.5 out of 10 for sound quality and built quality.. And also it comes with a carrying pouch + 2 set extra ear buds both of their quality were awesome. Overall very good headphone guys.. just go for it.. highly recommended 👍👍

If you are buying it for listening to music and you are on a tight budget then you are good to go. But the Mic is absolutely awful. There is no concept called 'Noise Cancellation', the mic itself creates noise. But the 'Bass' is quite good. But the 3D sound effect is not good. The wire's build quality is good but the earphones seems quite cheap. Personally after using it for music and gaming, I will not recommend you to buy this for playing mobile games. But for casual purposes it's reliable.

This is my second purchase for the same handsfree. first one also stopped working within the warranty period, bit as there's just one boat service centre in Ahmedabad, which happens to be so far from my home it didn't make sense to travel back and forth for a 500 rs handsfree. I decided to get another one in same model as I liked the tanglefree cord, but it was a mistake.I got the new one in September beginning and iy started having connectivity issue within a month, stopped totally by the end of oct. Boat doesn't provide pickup service, and it doesn't make sense to travel to another end of the city to get it exchanged. Boat product's quality has decreased significantly

If had to give a review of this product in one line that would be ""pure bliss for bassheads""And if for the detailed review let's starts with the packagingIt's simple clean and clearYou'll get 2 extra pair of eartips, 1 carrying pouch, earphone and booklet and a warrenty card.Now the build qualityIn the price range of 550 rs the build quality is good, the wire is sturdy.The housing is made out of plastic though it doesn't look or feel cheap.You get 3 buttons for call and volume up down, which is really rare in this price range.Next and most important is soundIt's a really a joy to listen edms and party mixes. You get that thumping vibrating bass.Trebles I'll say goodMids are lost in effect to create the bass, youLosse the details.Vocals are clear.The earphones are loud enough to enjoy songs in 70% volume level.So to summarise I'll say if you want details clear crisp sound then you have to up your budget a little bit and go for some other brands like sony or maybe jbl.And if you need the thumping base, you need  a earphone for pubg then just close your eyes and press the buy button.For the price of 449-550 it's a steal deal.

I'm not a gym guy, so I can't tell about its ergonomics while doing gym.I've been using this for 6 months now, even now I don't get any sound distortion. The drivers are very capable. It comes with a good amount of accessories for this price range. Sound quality is just fine! Bass is balanced (the amount of bass can be changed by most of the devices).Use it carefully and it will last for 1+ years. I can also it's better than is predecessors. Satisfactory purchase!

Pros1. Durable2. Lightweight3. Reasonable PriceCons1. Not good for exercise, walking etc, it comes off from ear.2. It doesnt fit into your ear properly.3. Noise cancellation is poor.4. The read rubber flap attached to the earbud is a hopeless innovation and I pulled it off because it hinders the headset to fit into the ear.Purchase - boAt Bassheads 152 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic...

Review after 8 months of use.1.Durability - good. The wires are intact and i use it in laptop as well as phone. The wires are pretty strong and lasted longer than other costly earphones.2. Sound quality- its poor in high volumes. If you use it with laptops to be on calls at work then its pretty fine. Mic also is good for these normal use. Not good for listening to music as it has lot of noise3. Wearability- Comfortable while standing. Really uncomfortable while sleeping or while scrolling phone lying on the couch.4. Conclusion- i wanted an earphone below 500 rs which will not break off durle to excessive use on laptop shaft as well as serve the purpose of attending calls. For the money offered the quality is good. If you are looking for an earphone as a music lover. This option might not serve the purpose.

Have been using this for 2 months now. The audio is quality is good. The Ear wings are very discomforting after extended use so i have removed them completely.Two Main problem areas for me are:1: The mike has to be held very close to the mouth as the other person always complains that its not audible. ( I Don't face this issue with other wired/bluetooth headphones i have)2: The link of the earpiece head and base has become loose all of a sudden and it comes off and all the wires are exposed. Even removing the ear piece lightly after use separates the assembly.Going for a warranty claim. Will update the ratings and reviews after the warranty process.**********Update:  the earpiece loose casing caused the wires inside to break. TERRIBLE AFTER SALES SERVICE.claiming  warranty on website redirects you to their closest service centers.*****On first visit the service center was closed despite working hours.On second they said they have closed office for Boat and no longer work with boat.Called on call center and it keeps you on waiting to connect with representative but never gets connected.EXTREMELY disappointing.  I have already wasted 200rs worth of fuel to visit service center for 500rs worth of earphones. NEVER BUYING AGAIN.

its have nice sound but what I experienced in boat 225 was much better even built quality was better of boat 225 but boat 242 is more attractive and it also give nice sound .its sound loudness is muh far better then its other competitors rven I tried SoundCloud q10 and claw g11 but both sound was little low as compare to this earphone butits cons is that it have loud sound which sometimes mis with other sound and create little difficulty in identifying different sound...I am using it for pubg .....and really enjoying it
"

This earphone(boat bassheads 242, black and red version) is ok for some loud music jonras like rock, etc. as the bass is overpowed. People listning to light musics will no love it. Vocals are not that good but you can't expect much in this price range. But if the wouldnt had overpowered the bass(upper bass), the sound would have been more balanced. But one thing, the cable quality is awsome. And this is the only best one in this range. If you want a balanced sound, try something from jbl.🙂

First of all, the product was same as shown in the pictures! (Both material wise & quality wise!)The hooks can be detach from it, so u can use it as your wish and comfortable!! Then comes to the features like sound controls ,is good! & also in quality wise too, it's  too good for both sound & bass!  In terms of rating, I will give 5 stars for both sound and bass and comes to noise cancellation, will give 4.8 bcz it is not100% but that's not at all a problm. Bcz when comes too these range headphones these percentage is good enough ! (If we want 100% percentage noise cancellation nd much more sound and bass, should go for an over ear headphone like that range!!That type also available in boAt!) The last but not the least, that's about the add on things in the package! I like the cute pouch and sticker.... Bcz I am like a person who loves these kinds of lil cute things..!!  And Ofcourse extra ear- buds nd warranty card and a brochure like one also included! Overall, this is such a beautiful one type! A beautiful In ear headphone worth the price!! I loves this, boAt! Thank you for the Amazon,for safely deliver the product in this pandemic situation too, on the right time as mentioned in the order!! Thank you!❤️

Review after about 3 months of usage:Since I've used both the Boat Bassheads 242 and Boat Bassheads 225 as well, the review is as a comparison between the two.Sound: Signature Boat sound. Almost same in both.Fit: 242s fit better.Design: 242s have an ear-friendly, plastic bud, 225s have large, metallic bud.Wire: 225s have tangle free wire.Jack: 225s have L-shaped jack.P.S. I felt like BRICK while writing this review. (For those who don't know, Brick is a character in a show called The Middle. That's all I can say.)Happy buying!

This was my 2nd purchase for this headphones. Initially I bought spirit lime color. That was worth for money. Build Quality was solid & sturdy. It lasted for more than 18 months even after rough use.2nd time I bought the same piece in Neon Green color, but wire quality was compromised. The rubber coating of the wire expanded & wire got spiraled & crumpled within 5 months of use. Also one thing I noticed that coating of wires were completely different.There might be 2 possibilities: 1. Different colored Headphones have different quality. 2. This time the product was NOT genuine as my 1st purchase was from different website.

After uses of 2 month it's one side pair are not working. But Really nice quality earphones and bass are superb. Perfectly fit on your ear and very deep bass amazing sound you don't need up to volume 60%, I get on  ₹449, in this price segment really awesome performance but wire quality are not as to much fine, But good earphones.

I bought this earphone after my 3yr old Sennheiser CX275s broke. Though this product is marketed as bass oriented, I found it to be neutral but somewhat lags in vocals. I need to raise the volume to the top to experience it. The old one which had a neutral sound o/p had better bass effect and overall sound clarity than this one.Yes, it is not right to compare a 1500 Rs earphone with 499 Rs one but still, I was hyped with the basshead brand name. So, It is a good earphone for the price it demands and you can go for it as it is one the best VFMs in the Market. Need to check how long it works fine without any issues.

Using it for 8 months now. I have never expected a company like Boat and that too a relatively cheap product in their ouvre, would survive my usage for that long.Sound is really good compared to ubon or other brands in this range. Boat had a diluted JBL sound, at least that's what I inferred when I used their first product, but this headphone has a sound akin to Sony and I like it. (I personally prefer Sony, Sennheiser over JBL, for their  warmer and more fulsome sound).Also the piping they did with the wire is the icing, and I believe that single handedly stretched it's longetivity.Very happy with what I got, Boat has earned my trust truly. They improved.

Just after one month of use, it's malfunctioning and the after sales service is pathetic they have no professional approach or responsibility towards their customers.I was told to take an appointment before coming to the service center and gave me a date 10 days later on my whatsapp number.I mean if you have rules of appointment before coming to service center it should be mentioned atleast on your website.So I did not have a good experience.

This is my 1st Boat product. My mother uses Airdopes which has amazing sound and tonality. These headphones however come affordable with an awesome design and futuristic look with dynamic sound, bass and beats which crisp vocals..really awesome for someone who likes and enjoys Rock, Metal, Blues.

Im giving 3 star because of the product that i received was defected after 1 month , the problem is ,one side headset is not functioned , after filing complaint with boat service center , their replaced me with a new product within 5 days , otherwise i will give 4 star to this product ..

It's been few weeks and volume buttons are acting up! Probably because of the sweat due to workout. I bought this hoping that button won't stop working by catching some sweat but it was a big let down. I have ruined many earbuds while working out and this one didn't turn out to be any different. What a disappointment. Good sound tho!!

So, here I am reviewing boat bassheads..Pros:Good(really good, thundering bass)good sound qualitygood buildCons:Bad treble-cant hear the voice unless you lower the bassWould have preferred a braided cable and insulated cableWould have preferred a warranty card to register for the product like sony....it says u can register only when your device is broken.....I'm insecure...Apart from that, great sound, great quality(not best), all good but too much bass!

As expected from boat, the sound was pretty good, the bass and treble balance was decent and also it was pretty comfortable to wear. It's better than 225 model because they were little bit heavy. The buttons helped me a lot whenever I wanted to change songs but didn't wanted to turn on my screen in the middle of night. A 4 star from me cause, if it had braided cables or maybe flat type cables I would definitely give it a 5 stars.

Writing this review after 3+ months of usage.PROS* Good build quality* Decent noise isolation* Bass is good. Bass lovers will like this but it is a bit too much to my liking* Mic placement and clarity is greatCONS* Normal cable (not flat one as the pics suggest)* Experiencing sharp pain in the ears when using for 30+ minutes (biggest drawback)OVERALLDecent headphones but poor design which brings a lot of pain to your ears!
"

It would kill your device's audio jack!Boat made this marginally longer and thicker than many other things in the market; to pretend universal.Once you managed to insert into your device you might start to hear electronic voices which is kinda creepy. If you are a guy like me - used it on a laptop, Good luck with that.

Bought these a month and 12 days ago.. as a regular user of earphones, headphones and Bluetooth devices.  These earphones are a disappointment.  After spending money on this I can officially say worst purchase ever.- Left earphones works fine, but right won't function.- The call button automatically calls, plays music, does any random thing.-  with an amazing past experience with this company I'm 100% convinced that they need to work on quality, after sales services and replacement.- I live far from service center almost 30kms but they want me to come down there and get it checked for replacement? How is it fair and reasonable?Sounds quality in first week was so awesome it started hurting my ears. Even while ridding you can hear other vehicles at distance of 6-12ft at full volume.**Update**Now the call, volume button has stopped working permanently and it's now useless. worth buy ever.
"
1246,"
ProsSound quality is one of the best in the price range.The bass is not that high, so its good if you prefer vocals more.It has full 3 button control instead of the one button which makes it easier for music controlConsThe wire is WEAK. It broke in a few monthsIt has no flat  or braided cable instead a thin plastic one.( it gets tangled always)The earbuds are of bad quality. The buds hole is wider which makes sound better but the quality of the bud is not good infact its worse than any boat earphone.It doesn't have L shaped or angled jack which i don't prefer.
"

Earphones are great in look and feel. It takes some time to adjust so might hurt few days when using continously for long time but later it will become fine. That extra pouch along with earphones is great. All round nice product at very reasonable price only issue is wire is very thin and so need to be very careful.
"

Looking Good.Grip Great.Tangle free And Flexibility is ok. (If you want go with Basshead 225)Wire Quality Great.Free Cloth Pouch in the box.Pouch is not suitable for Earphone. But you can store old-valuable coins or pendrive, card reader etc.Boat After Service Experience is Awesome.So I am happy with all boat products.

Sound quality is decent. Bass is very rich. Noise cancellation is sub-par. It comes with some extra pair of buds. Finishing is perfect and colour combination makes it even more attractive.I feel the wiring is a little fragile and might not be suitable while running or walking or some other kind of movement.

I am typing this review after 2 weeks I had used this product and my personal experience was it's not comfortable to wear after one hour. Sound quality is sharp and good but I notice it get reduce after one week of usage product packaging and build is quite attractive and its water resistant and good for daily use.Conclusion : i will say please don't go for this earphone they are good but you can get better ear phones and some point this ear phone design is annoying and it's not comfortable to wear after certain time you will get this point when you use this ear phone for after that its start irritating and itching in ears I will suggest you better go for different option 😉

For the money for which we are getting this headphones it works like charm and do the basic things right. Eliminates the surround sound but it’s far away from noise cancellation feature which is technically not possible to include in the package. Fare amount of bass can be enjoyed and the quality of the sound is good.

So it leaks my media audio into the mic and i got it replaced from  far away service center and the problem is still the same my friends can hear their voice from my side and also the movie if i am watching any while they are on a call or confrence with me and this is unbearable and as the replacement has the same problem and they have far away service centers this means this is the problem with every set and i want a fine replacement probably wont get any i regret my decision and will not buy anything from boat ever again wont recommend the whole company to anyone

I bought it on republic day sale so i got it for 349rs and i would say a great product in this range of price...Bass is good ...noise cancellation is amazing...

Sound QualityJust one word ""amazing""The trebles are just fabulousInstrument separationd are amazingHigh lows are great.Bass it is not overpowered but it gave thumping bass.I could hear the sound only upto 65% volume, it gets too loud at 100%.Sound leakage was there only at 100%Build QualityI had the Black variant and the build was good enough for day to day use. It has a rubberized coating over the wires.ComfortIt takes 2 to 3 days to get use to with the ear hooks. And they work great it holds your ear firmly.ConclusionMust Buy earphones under Rs. 500, I got it at Rs. 399 during the sale, so always wait for the sale time. Oh and also they give you a pouch which is really handy to keep your earphones safe from physical damage. Overall a great earphones under Rs. 500

I am writing the review after the use of almost 2 year .As I aspect sound quality is great . Full of bass and punchy sound and have great price as per the quality . Wire quality is also good dont reject it by its look , it is very durable bet for sports use but not good for calls .But after 14 month its one side earpiece stop working , its earcover comes out due to cheap quality . And the mic is not good since starting . Not audible during online classes .As per my review good to buy but last for short time and not for calls and online classes. So 4⭐⭐⭐⭐

It's a great product from Boat. I needed a earphone which I could use while riding & this serves the purpose very well. The ergonomic Design helps the earphone to stay in place without hurting or having stress on your ears. Additional feature of Volume control helps to reduce or increase volume without having the need to take out your phone.Sound Quality : 9/10Design : 7/10 ( 7 Because of thin wires)Cons : The only risk I identified is the thin wires. Since I'm using it during riding, I am not sure how long these thin wires will last. It would have been a perfect design if they had used the Flat wire design in this particular model.Overall a Good product with a risk of Wire getting stretched & damaged.

Best in class... I can't believe boat has made such a good sounding earphone at this price point. It in itself justifies the price..... I own a senhheiser cx 180 so I know what a premium earphone sounds like.It sounds almost like a premium earphone and the sound signature is balanced not too bassy and mids and highs were clear... Wire quality is soft to touch and feels durable but have to see how long it lasts both (externally and internally)....the connector is not L-shalped so it looks like the wire may get damaged at the joint.Also it doesn't tangle in my everyday use. Overall value for money

I have been using this to mainly play COD in mobile1.The foot steps can be heard better than players around you so it works like a charm in finding those sneaking behind you or coming towards your in close range2.You can never wear it the wrong way due the ear lobes supporter or whatever they are called.3. I have slept over it and it doesn't break unless you're sleeping on a rock by time traveling to stone age.4. Earlobes will pain if the supports are not worn in a right way5. The extra clip provided to clip on to your shirts works well helpful to keep the microphone right in its audio signal pickup range thus providing consistent audio output to listener unless you're networks isnt goodFinally for better audio output do not use the ear buds that are provided as they aren't the best so if you have a friend having spare ear buds of  Sony MDR-XB55 Extra-Bass( pro tip: Ya you can fake your friendship for a while like everyone these days untill you get those spare buds  ) these ones they sit flushly in your ears there by creating its own seal thus reducing sound entering your ear from outside and creating a sense of artificial depth and clarity which the original OEM earbuds lack as they feel flimsy

No doubt gives a perfect & above decent acoustics..!!steal deal at ₹399..Looks well made (can last long for sure)go for it..one star less:you should reduce last 2 volume points to have smoother effects for bass/treble rich songs ( voice rich songs are classy n not an issue )..

I used this headset for about 8 months, And it broken link this without any reason.First the right side speaker stops working , then I was using this one sided hearing headset for 3 week's.Now by today that too stopped working.The only thing that is working Even now is the microphone ( I tested by doing an voice recording in phone).Its little weird for the headset to stop working and broken near this pin is awkward.I was an big fan of using the headset with moderate sound levels.So I always go with boat headset as its driver fits me perfect.But now I'm totally disappointed with this product and I suggest not to go with this product for purchase.Sorry for negative review.Peace & Thanks

First of all the very important point is build quality, it will not go anywhere no matter how roughly u use it.Sound quality is excellent you can't listen to it on full volume although its clear enough.Comfortable - no need to adjust again and again.Bass should be become lil better but still you can't take is as con.Pouch and extra buds are useful and awesome.Surely go for it

Bass quality: is a bummer, though the name of this earphone is basshead 242, i feel base to be inferior and very inadequate to my taste as well as in contrast to the treble/ highs base feels rather weak.Sound profile: Clear sound. Dynamic range is ""Fine"" .Though the lack of bass makes it feel hollow. Don't go by the reviews calling it a great bass-y earphone, it's not.Good build quality- as per first impressions. Though I'm skeptical about how long it'll last.Noice Cancellation: No active cancelling(off course) but seals pretty well in ear canal so is quite adequat for isolation in a noicy bus joirney. Earphone is pretty loud.The higher end in the sound profile is overpowered. Sharp sounds are more prominent in comparison to base/lows.

Writing this review afrer initial use for few hours.1. I wanted to return the product as it hurts my ears (tried all the possible adjustments but it still would hurt) but Amzon wants to replace the same product and I don't see any point in that as the design itself is a challenge (may be only for me)2. The sound quality is fine however bass is not as the company advertises. My old JBL (C110) priced at 649/- as of now vs 499/- for this product is many times better (tested at the same song at the same volume and felt the difference).

Likes:Look is attractive, fitting to ear is good, it won't fall easily, noice cancellation is good but for that ear piece has to fit properly. Sound is good and feel the bass at top of volume. Volume control buttons and play and pause button is Handy.Dislikes:delicate product, wire quality thin and seems not durable, buttons made up of plastic, bass is good at top notch volume. At 50-60percent bass not good. Fitting to ear is good but can not put for long time. Started getting discomfort in some minutes of usage.

Bass is good and the sound quality, pitch and noise cancellation is also good.Pros:-1) Suitable when using in workouts, and running.2) Fits in ear without slipping.3) Wire is tangle free.4) supper Affordable in this price range. under 6005) Better then ang other realme sur senheisher earphones.6) Light and sturdy7) Earphone jack is made of metalCons-:1) Ear hooks can cause irritation in ears if you wear for long time and very regularly, in my case I felt uncomfortable after 50 hours of use.(don't worry about the ear hooks , they are detachable)2) Plastic earphones, not even single part made of metal.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖*IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR PERFORMANCE OVER LOOKS GO FOR BOAT BASSHEADS. 172.

The product it too good at this cost itself , there is even one year manufacturer warranty along with the it. T o be precise it a astonishing product.

This is actually good. I was skeptical while buying it since it was the new Boat in ear model. But they didn't disappoint. It's actually good and even durable. I love it so much. However the extra ear pads might hurt your ears if worn too long but they are detachable. The sound quality is actually great too. I wanted something lowkey for video editing and gaming. This works perfect.

The product meets basic standard for the price, build quality isn't great, lost audio on one side after 3 months, pleasantly the replacement processing was simple and fast, I got a new one in a weeks time. The second one worked for next 7 months and one head opened up with loose soldering. So in effect including one replacement lasted for a year, sound quality was fairly consistent until the last month of failure.For the price and for general rough usage  it's decent enough.

You will get ear pain for the continuous use of 10 to 15 minutes.Initially I tried the basic version of boat ear phone and started getting ear pain, I thought it might be one of the defect piece, therefore I tried the advanced version next time and experiencing the same ear pain.

wire quality is excellent, mic is good, having pouch to carry earphones is best... But not that good in terms of fit not that good and one more thing..

If u r a true music lover than go for JBL C-100❤️ best earphone under 1k, no match of that earphone in terms of sound quality.. Even I brought that JBL C-100 three times, thebedt earphone..

Initially I gave 4 stars for this product. Now I came here voluntarily to give five stars. I bought a new earphones on June 2021 and it was not working properly after 6 months. So I claimed for warranty...submitted my details...Boat didn't even ask a question they sent me a new earphones. Thanks Boat You've got a lifetime customer:)

Best piece of earphones I have ever bought period. And boy, have a bought a ton of expensive ones through these years. I only base this off the awesome sound quality. It's ethereal, highs, lows, bass you name it. I had skullcandys and bose ones thinking honking bass is the real thing, but these ones make me realise how wrong I was. Great overall sound quality, the melody comes just perfect through the bass which is not underwhelming by any stretch of the imagination. I bought it for 800 rupees, if you get it for less than 2k, it's a steal. (Slight exaggeration)The build is awesome too, the wire looks cool, durable and won't wind up making your life difficult. I hope this lasts as this is my second day of listening to it.10/10

BoAt is a good brand for bass I used this earphones before not now ( because I lost them somewhere) while I'm using them I feel grate but only thing disappointing is that ear hook Because of that my ears getting pain after 30min of use so I removed them problem solved I feel gud when I used these BoAt earphones later I tried the ""infinity"" brand zip 20 earphones after losing boAt just tried new but belive me my mind changed on BoAt after listening to infinity I mean infinity is better than BoAt because I observed the vocals, Tribble, noise cancelation, deep bass for rich quality just wow to infinity zip 20 it is better to choose infinity if u are looking for a decent and Cristal clear sound with deep bass .. if u want heavy bass go for BoAt my infinity earphones also lost one week back while trip so I ordered infinity zip20 again 💗Note : for better experience I'm using bass booster app

12 days after buying this.Pros-1.Sound profile of this earphone is good.Bass,Sound,treble everything is well balanced.2.Build quality is superb too, even tho it's entirely made out plastic.Cons-1.Even after nearly wearing this for close to couple of weeks,I don't like the fit of this earphone, they should excellent but they just don't fit me. If you want a better fit go with the ""realme buds 2"".2. These looks cheap as hell.Cons-

This is my second purchase. Good earphone. Bass is pretty good. Clear sound. Good outside noise cancelation. Light on ear and doesn't hurt.Only cons in this purchase, Boat has removed the outer  protective conduit from the wire which was earlier there in my first purchase.I don't whether it is duplicate or Boat has changed the design.
"

Literally the best earphones in the price range. The 10mm drivers thump a good bass, but not the best. Very comfortable and stays in ears with the hooks on. Better than the boAt bassheads 225 of the same price range. The boAt bassheads 225 are very bad for using while sleeping. But these are better compared to those and these also have in-line volume controls and are absent in the bassheads 225. I highly recommend these instead of boAt bassheads 225.

The boat company is in impression that human ears should adjust to boat products. Although this product is nice and gives very good result and high definition output, ear pain due to buds not being soft. I have 4 different boat headphones and boat has never rectified yet. Perhaps it's a void that other companies will fill.

So I bought this product and it was working fine. But after just 1 week it started having problems. Whenever I plug in my headphones it would have that zzzzzzzz sound we all get from televisions. And then I would have to remove it and plug it in again in a different position to get it working properly.The reason I still rated this 3 stars is because WHEN it is working it is awesome. The sound quality is amazing and the bass is also top class.And if any of you are wondering why I didnt replace a defective product is because I noticed the problem after the replacement time period had expired. So couldn't do anything.

After using for 2 months the best I can say is it's worth of money but not for base lovers, if you prefer Indian brand it's good for you, you even get warranty period which is useful (not really lol), a pouch and yes some ear buds which were missing from my box , and that Sucks the most .🥲
"

Earphones are of the cheapest quality I have ever seen. Its not even worth Rs 50/-Waste of money. I bought it for in-the-ear support. But the quality of the ear support is made of very delicate silicone and not even comfortable to fit in the ears. Also the whole ear phones quality is also worst. Even the Road side earphones would look more durable than this.

This is the best wired earphone at this price. Just can't find any cons. Braided wire, carry pouch, cable manager, extra eartips, ear hooks.You get everything inside the package.Coming to audio quality. It's amazing and the passive noise cancellation works great because of amazing in ear fit and has great bass.Also it comes with 1 year warranty. You just can't ask any more at this price..Far better than realmebuds2 overall. Realmebuds2 only looks better than this and has magnet which is missing here. But tbh cable clip manager which comes with boat is more useful than the useless magnet in realmebuds2 because magnet has no practical use in wired earphoneFinal verdict: It's the best. Just go for it.
"

Go for Real me buds 2 if you like chan chan sounds with bassOr, boat bassheads 242 if you like room speaker setup like bassNone of them has wide sound stage meaning music plays close to air with out wide strereo.... To get awesome sound quality go for Philips pro 6305k

Not compatible with my LG G6 mobile. I have to rotate its jack little to see where it will play. Wire quality is good and it will work for long time. Sound quality is also good.

I went out for walking for 2 days with these earphones on, the 3rd day the right ear phone started making static noises due to the light sweat entering the microphone.The microphone stopped working just after 2days and the right earphone STOPPED after 5days.Complete earphone stopped working in 8days, Now i can't even return the order...lol.These earphones are TRASH.DONOT BUY THESE EAR PHONES.It feels like i've been scamed.Go for JBL or RealMe ear phones instead.

Just fell for the reviews, it's total crap. There is no high low mid bass and nothing it's just flat and sound like 50rs roadside earphones. Realme is 100times better than this, better avoid if you buy you will regret, since there is no return!!!

I have been Fan of this company (boAt). Nice build quality. Unlike previous headphones (not boAt headphones) you can use boAt headphones roughly (keeping in your pockets or pull the (not too hard) mistakely). It will sustain and can work atleast 7 to 8 months. Good life shelf. The price was bit more i felt.The sound is way better than any other headphones (at this price)

Trust me this earphone is far much better than my 2000 Rs one plus bullet Z bass edition earphone. Sound quality is good. Bass is quiet low. But you can adjust with the quality for this price.Overall for people who are looking good budget friendly wired earphone please trust me and buy this.

The cost is a way higher in comparison to the product and sound quality. The sound quality is not that great. It has weak bass quality as well. More of all the design is the worst problem with it. It starts hurting your ears in very short interval of time. The sharp edges in the design keep poking your ears badly. Not recommended at all.
"

Sound quality is really superb, No issues with sound quality output. Only thing I'm not satisfied is build quality., Could have been better. Wire is too thin and plastic quality is not good, could have been better. I hope they improve it. Other than worth the money.

One of the finest i have used ..its has an amazing sound quality ..they fit so well blocking almost 90% of outside noise . You can hear even the smallest beat playing in the background with perfect amount of bass.Water and swear resistance with good quality sound ..makes it 10 out of 10.

The earplug got removed on 8th day of Delivery. Hence return window closed. Amazon says ""7 days over, so u r ur Own.. we don't care, it's ur funeral now"". Amazon doesn't have correct customer care number details of BoAt. Lodged a complaint on BoAt website and message assured response in 2 days.. No response so far..Even the customer care number given on their website itself not exist. I lost my money and confidence in Amazon platform.

Boat 103 is far better than this, at a cheaper price with magnetic earbuds.. never waste your money on this product.Cons  - sound quality is poor especially at higher volumes  - poor bass performance  - No magnetic earbuds  - Jack is not good. It's not even an angled jack.  - Rubber tips/buds for this product sucks.. its bad.Pros  - It has a braided anti stretch cable.  - Nice ergonomics and looks good (depends on  perspective) & lot of colour choices.  - Its splash & sweat resistant.****** They say its IPX4, i haven't used it in such conditions to check this out

I purchased this headphone because of WFH and have following review:Pros: Good quality build ,sound is great, light weight, good material is used, delivered on time,packging was good, fit in ear perfectly.Cons: It has button for stop/play, volume up and down and surprised that it didn't work. During my zoom/google call through laptop I tried this buttons and none of them was working. Although i rely heavily on mouse and control volume/stop/play with mouse so not a big issue for me but it should work as it is provided and for that we have charged. So i have given 3 stars otherwise it deserve 4.5.

I've been using Boat for atleast half a decade and it's been pretty well. I've bought a ton of Boat products. But this time Boat Bassheads 242 is a big disappointment. It stopped working in a month and they repaired it (not replaced) then again it stopped working in 3 months, again they repaired it (not replaced). And again in the fifth month it has stopped working. TBH I am not even gonna get it replaced because Im fed up of the services. Boat just lost a customer.P.S. - I keep my earphones/headphones really nicely and I used this product even less.

I have been using it for a couple of months. The covers put on the housing part might not fit every individual. The covers on the sound filter tip are becoming loose after using it for a month or so, also the spare covers that came along, have different sizes so they won't fit if you miss your one of the cover. This is not good for running because the filter mesh will become dirtier quickly and you can't clean it. You might feel like throwing it away after you spoil the filter mesh and you won't feel like wearing it at all after that.Overall you will hate using this product after a month or two. The sound quality is good but the user experience is bad.

One of the best earphone that can buy under 500 rupees. The sound quality is so great and the noise cancellation is so perfect. The design of this earphone makes it it perfectly fit in ears. This earphone will be a perfect competition for JBL. I have used earphones of different brands like JBL, syska, Ptron, Boat. But this one is something else I like this sound bus and also design very match. If it comes under 500 just go for it.Sound Quality: 4.5/5Noise Cancellation: 4/5Bass Quality: 4/5

Build quality and package is good. Nice earclips (but may hurts if wear for a long time), Extra earbuds, Holder clip and a nice pouch also included. Bass is quite good, over sound is Ok. Its a budget headset, so can't expect much more. But, for daily use, it will satisfy use. I have purchased the Blue one, which is quite impressive look and sturdy. Let's see its durability.

Sound Quality is not that great Sound is pretty flat / bass is totally 0.Build quality of the wires is good but the ear piece part is made up of cheap plastic and too light.I also have Boat Airdopes 381 which has 7mm drivers their sound quality is much better than this wired earphone. This time boat let me down.
"

Sound quality sturdiness all good i just gave 4 stars because some improvements are needed like the fitting of sleeves becomes inconvenient after a use of 2-3 months as in my case they fall off while removing the earbuds or gets stuck in the ears. It becomes irritating if it happens frequently.Rest good🎉🎊🎉
"

First of i just love the design nd fit finish, then talking about it's feel in ears is good, tips are soft enought nd due to earhooks this don't fall of like boat 240 in earphones, first thig you will notice when you pulg those in your ears is is half of the outside noize is reduced nd the sound you hear is crisp nd clear with a good bass with it's 19mm drivers. Mic on this is something differnt, you'll feel like this has a active noice cancellation on, Cabel use on this earphones is also of good quality. What else you want from a 500rs earphone. Nd you can use it for gaming it goes well with it to. 🙂
"

No matter what kind of earphone you are buying from boat it will always have only one issue 'bass'.Though I have to change my earphone twice because it's Jack wasn't working. It's warranty period wasn't over so it's normal for me to get a new one.Though they always delay the process of customer service and change.But soon it's going to 1 year since I have brought it so it's worth my money.Cheap wired earphones even won't last for a month. But I used it to1 year so it's okay

I got the pair in blue color for 499/- and for the price, the earphones are good. The Mic is well placed so the audio quality to the other person is great and the buttons are tactile and easy to operate. The soft velvet pouch that comes with it is good too.The only con would be the 2 thin wires from the connector to the earbuds, so it needs delicate usage.

Writing the review after 2months of use.. noise cancelation is good but not better.  Bass quality is very good.. but it can be used for max 1 and a half hour not more than that.. we'll get earache.. if you are using this for less than 1 hour continously,  then its good👍

I have used worse earphones that cost more than this, this is pretty good at this price , that being said if only boAt is seeing this review I want you to listen to me. The ear phones are pretty comfortable regardless it being 10mm driver it fits little too well that it doesn't completely seal my ears even after using the largest silicon tip , I want boAt to introduce new product as such but with a bigger driver make 12.5 or even 15mm.

Pros-Excellent sound quality even at volume 2.Earphone Pouch.Length cable.Fast delivery in one day with no delivery charge.Volume and pause play button.Cons-No heavy bass (not for bass lavers).Very Thin cable ( I dono how many days it will come, but good thing is it comes with 3layer fibber let's hope best).No L shaped 3.5mm jack.No gold plated 3.5mm jack.The design is made of plastic no metal, it looks cheap.Ear hook hurts but u can removeMy final verdict is if u r melody lover don't waste even a sec just but it ,if you r a bass lover go for some other products.

As compared to Boult audio bass heads x1 , these earphones are very similar and the price of these headphones is higher due to these earphones has volume rockers and boult does not have.Other than that you would find everything same with higher price of ₹200.Also if you use them or put for 1 hour or more straight these earphones will hurt your ears. My ears started paining.Although these headphones are also good.

I use it as a daily  gameCons: After using it for 60-70 minutes you will feel slight discomfort due to the ear wing and also you feel discomfort whiling using it in while on a pillow in bed.( the ear hooks are detachable) it gives more comfort.but it is the best wired headset in the range and it is better than their own 225 headphones...i highly recommend it for people who need A good bass headphones

It's a really good one wired earphone.The sound quality is pretty good. I usually listen music with 70-80% volume. In good quality audio file or gaming side it's enough.Don't try to go for full volume as bass is not that high, it's unbearable on ears.Quality is good. You will also get different size of buds which suits your ear.

These headphones are epic the sound quality is best ever. The noise cancellation also cancels a lot of noise but not too much, u can still hear whats happening in the background a little bit. They aare very comfortable there is just one problem that after wearing them for 2 Or 3 hrs ur ear starts itching. But over all it is good. If u want them for gaming I would not reccomend these as u can get better over ear headphones specifically for gaming.

The bass is quit good but when the it comes to the sharp sounds it distort them and gives a fuzzy noise in the background. The build quality looks quite cheap for the brand and as I have used many products from the house of BOAT.

I have used it for several months, still it has super sound quality without any noises.It is well fit in our. So you can use it when you are jogging or running.Additional advantage for it is having volume control buttons.One thing you need to consider, you cannot feel pure bass in this price segment. If you want pure bass, you should go for higher price. Because it is having high sound not high bass. Bass lovers should go for over the ear headphones with high prices.

Hello everyone,I have received this headphone today 16/10/2021. I had placed on order based on the best rating reviews of customers and this experience is been worst I can say it so disappointing me that the headphone sound quality is so poor there is no bass it is just a flat normal sound with some weird hit tap tap on left headphone also the volume (-) button isn't working. The response of volume & pause button isnt quick. I would request the dealer to replace this item with a new piece.Thanks,

This earphone is very decent overall. Sound quality, comfortability wise, this product is value for money.The only thing which itches is its build quality. Not very durable (the wire is not flat shaped or tangle free). Wire coating is very ordinary. And the worst of all, the shape of pin. Never go for straight pin. It is a nightmare. Taking it out from the jack is basically a invitation for rapid wear and tear. And it's not super convenient either. I wonder why Boat decide to ditch the L-shaped pin for this model.

Although my family uses boat brand earphones, but this time the product turned out to be faulty. There comes a constant disturbing sound during phone calls just like an old fan blade moving.

I'm not a hardcore fan of specs on headsets. However I see only build quality and durability. I have put it in my jeans , pulled it out ,. Nothing happened. It's built sturdy.

Good earphones if you want heavy bass. The mic is excellent and the fins don't hurt your ears as I thought they would. They also have a 1 year warranty so that's nice.BUT: As is with a lot of boAt products, they have durability issues. The thin wire on the earbuds is easy to wear out and within 6 months of usage I have managed to screw up the right earbud. I use them a bit roughly like anyone using them for casual listening and various locations would.

Decent headphones but doesn't have excellent bass output. I found Boult bass buds X2 better in bass performance in similar price range.The flexible ear clips attach to the ear nicely and doesn't slip off like other earphones. Good design.

I liked the earphones however I can feel the audio to be more left sided than balanced. I tried this on various devices and the effect had been the same. Also, the mic quality is not up to the mark. I am a singer and I sing using the mic to record songs, the output is, nope.Otherwise, if you just want to listen to the audio, go for it.

If you are looking for just loud bass this might be perfect, but if you want a clear quality bass this might not be a good one. The sound is loud and sometimes sharp which might make it difficult to listen to it for a long time. Also the shape and extra rubber support gives a bit of pain after long usage.For 500 bucks this is a good earphone.

I bought this for the second time because the first 1 is amazing! I've been using mine for almost a year and it is absolutely amazing till date. So, I decided to buy another one, this time for my sister. The product arrived within a day but the performance was so terrible I think it was fake. The bass was bad and the audio wasn't centered. It felt as if the sound was coming from the left side no matter what I was listening to. Disappointed. Service was amazing tho. They picked up the return within a day of requesting for a refund.

hats off to Amazon for the delivery, I literally received the earphones in less than 18-19 hours. Product is marvellous in sound quality, bass quality is good tho. The reason i gave 4 stars is because of the pain which causes to my ears when am using it for a long time. Overall it’s a must buy earphones.

Sound quality is very good I have to check multiple Hollywood movies Bollywood movies event remix and much more..Kannoj cancellation is very much ethical.. if you are inside the train or at house you will get scold by your parents by not answering their calls.. it's that much cool.With this headphone you can listen Badshah songs with their original bass.. same goes for David Guetta music videos..I personally love this headphone and I purchased three others for my sisters and brother.

This is one of the best earphone purchases made by me. It has an amazing sound and bass quality, fits well into my ear and has good noise cancellation. I always find trouble finding good earphones because most of them do not fit into my ear and falls off. This one has a good design and fits well into the ear, the build quality is very good. The mic works very well too. My voice was heard clearly on the other side during calls. It works well on both mobile and laptop. The price is also extremely reasonable for this quality. I would 100% recommend to buy this headset.

Saw a review on youtube that said the audio was very clear. It wasnt. Audio is heavily bass boosted for no reason which is alright for some music but makes every other video i watch sound very muffled. On top the volume is amplified very heavily to the point where the minimum sound setting is still 3x as loud as other earphones can go. So couldnt use the earphones to listen to songs as i slept because the volume was too loud. Finally earphones statted producing loud static white noise making them unusable after 1 week. Horrible product all around. Just buy jbl or samsung for budget brand.

I'm writing this review after 6 months of usage.Initially I was ok but slowly i started facing problems.1) The wire entangles a lot. Since the wire is not slippery material it becomes difficult to straighten it up.2) The silicon holders come out easily. but its somehow locked in the earpiece so it wont fall off and lost so its a smaller problem3) The silicone caps come out easily. I lot it couple of times, luckily find it out and now being extra careful. Few times it was left in my ear itself. Funny.4) the buttons on the mouth piece are pretty hard and clunky.Although its not all hopeless stuffSound quality is satisfactory, Bass is good

The cable for this product comes with a rubber kinda laminated upon, it feels durable for a long time, it survived hitting a ceiling fan accidentally. But the problem comes with the earpiece, you'll find a net protecting the speaker which comes loose and can get damaged, it happened with me, would be better if it is built with plastic. Sound quality is amazing , noise cancellation done well, bass quality is fair for what Boat takes, i am also using JBL 650btnc, a premium headphone priced 10k. For my regular use, Boat gets on me more than JBL.

Good earphone quality for this price , i also like boat brand because service is best , if your earphone not working on warranty period ,you don't want to go service center , Company send person to your address , pick item and within 12 days your new item receive at your home . this service not give all brand ,that's why i like this brand.

hello everyone, if you are going to buy this earphone, i would suggest you to not buy this because of its built quality. Instead of this earphone you can buy same company product like boat 220/225 earphone because it comes with flat wire ( tangle free) and has a awesome built quality and i have been using this boat 220/225 earphone since March,2020. Its far better than this boat 242 earphone.

Just got it. Listened some old Kishore Kumar songs. Not impressed. Probably the right thing what ₹399 can get. MRP is ₹1,490 which is surely a marketing tact. Comes with a pair of extra buds and a carrying pouch and a clip. It's too early to comment on it's IPX4 water resistance. For sub ₹500 it's okay.1st edit: it tangles.

If your a music fanatic like me and are looking for a budget earphones with good bass then this ones totally worth it. Under 500/- I don't think you'll be disappointed. To be honest this is the second time I have ordered it. It's really sturdy and ofcourse due to carelessness it got stuck between my bike handle and the wire snapped (this was not the first time) but it always continued to supply powerful bass.. Go For It!! 😎✌️🎧

These earphones are really worth it for the price of 449. The ear hooks are just like a fashion or for just good appearance the ear hooks dont just fit comfortably in the ears other the earphones are simply great. The bass is just really good 10 mm dynamic drivers. The earphones cable quality is also good. Overall it is a value for money product. Do give it a try.

This earphone is worst one i had ever used.It does things automatically like mute calls,start speaker, cut phone calls and many more things which is just ridiculous. Such colours are just for attraction otherwise it is 3rd class. I think 100 rs earphone are much better than this one.

Its a good product overall for the price point. It has regular attributes like a normal earphone. Low bass, high treble and sometimes ridiculously high volume when the volume is max. It fits perfectly in my ear and has been 3 months since I have purchased it. The earphones for me works like a backup if my air dopes or my headphones aren't working at that point of time. I have no idea of regular use though.

Firstly i got a defective product, which got promptly replaced.Sound Quality:Like the name suggestes, this is purely for baseheads, the lows over power the mids & highs. Sound stage is very narrow and lacks instrument separation. Mids-vocals and treble is recessed and lacks in detail. Even the bass is lose. Overall not a great sounding earphones unless you are a basshead and dont care for overall sound quality and u just need bass, only then u can go for this earphone.

Pros:1)Dynamic frequency response is very awesome especially in this rate 👏👏.2) If played at higher volume No Distortion at all.3) Very light (eventhough 10 mm driver)never slipped from the ear even the removal of ear wings.4) It's jack and cable Very vey durable. 👌5) Such a wonderful treble response 👏.Cons:1)The only con is missing of solid thumping bass (225 beats 242 in thumping bass).

This maybe just a manufacturing defect but it is slightly panned to the right. Triggers someone who's really into music and sound. The so called ""Drivers"", jar when a part with good bass kicks in. These earphones are naturally too loud. I don't use more than 20% of the phone volume because of how loud it is. I am not a fan of bass-heavy earphones. I like it more balanced. But I bought these because of the fit. It stays in my ear no matter what. The buds did hurt me in the beginning but I got used to it. Didn't have the budget to buy the airpods so I got these

Good balanced sound for daily use. Soft eartips and the included buds of different sizes are comfortable. The lime green colour is easy to recognise in a black bag, and is not gaudy or too flashy. The only slight negative is that the white eartips show even the slightest of earwax. So, you'll want to keep cleaning them.

There are lots of earphones available in this price range like mi dual driver and basic , realme buds 2, boat 225 and JBL Earphones but problem with them is extreme bass which lead  to distortion of audio quality in mid tones and low tones and vocals are not damn clear to listen, but this 242 have done phonomenal job to balance the sound signature and it’s the 2nd best earphones in sound signature after sannheiser 180 street 2  under 800kAnd other earphones are metallic which is heavy and may cause pain in your ear after long useBut that is not the case with this 242 and its ipx 4 rated so no issues while using outdoors in rain or mistakenly fell in water which is a life saver sometimes.

Have used the product for about 3 hours and it hurts around the ears due to hard plastic body. Bass is just at the basic level like any other headphone.

Guys this is a must buy item! It have a really good sound quality. Noise cancellation is also good. And the bass quality is next level. If you want to check the sound quality and bass quality of the earphone check it with bohemian rhapsody : we will rock you, because this song have many different instrument play in all high and low tune.  I'm reviewing after 2 months of use. It has a good ear grip. PACKAGE INCLUDES: 1 boat earphone, 2 pairs of ear buds, 1 velvet cover fot keeping earphone safely in backpack or pocket while travelling. It's really worth money.

I personally use Sony XB series but, bought it for my mom who listens to Radio on her basic Nokia. Tried it on my smartphones (with PowerAmp, manual Eq). I am pretty sure Sony can't offer this performance at this price.Given the price, this is the last bargain guys.WOW! Not comparing Sony here.

If you are going to purchase it, think twice before taking such step. I have been using this product since June 2021 and it started showing problems after 1 month of use, so far I have managed to go with this. But now I have frustrated with this. There is a problem in right earpiece, when ever I am talking to some person the earpiece starts producing buzz sound and sometimes there is a click click sound if you move your head even a little bit. But I stable mode it's sound quality is very good.

These are too good if you ask me for the price range. Didn't expect an earphone to be so good at this price range. It sits up pretty well in your ears and you wont have to keep the volume 100 at any point of time. It is so good that in indoors even 60-70% volume does it. Probably when you go out and there is a lot of noise will you have to keep the volume at 80-90%. Go for it eyes closed.

worst design ever. Long term use gives pain in ears. The extra rubber given on top of earphone is of no use. At least they could have given magnets for both the speakers, so that the wires don't get tangled.No designing features in this earphone, Its old model only.Use it continuously for 1 hour and your ears 👂 hurt. Its one of the worst design ever.Check the lesser price earphones, they have the latest designing features.

Overall product is good but the right side of the earphone is always defective (has no bass) . I would suggest to purchase boat 225 instead of boat 242.

This boat 242 i purchased and first time came right side defective and then again after replacement also same problem arised. ....................................

First Impression : Feels kinda premium. It feels like it could get a bit further in to the ear. Not a firm fit. The green one has much damper color, not same as in the picture. Volume is way good. Overall not bad.After 1 month : REALLY BAD MIC. Longer use is uncomfortable due to the design, if you smile or do any facial expression, it does hurt and irritate. More treble than bass. Volume buttons are very helpful.Casual music listeners, joggers...etc etc go for it.If you are going to use this for calls, don't buy this.

Sound quality is good. But only the sound quality doesn't matter. The ear hooks got loose in just a week and it even comes out if you keep your headphones in your pocket. The clip when mounted, bends the wire. The 3.5mm plug is not L-shaped and at times its very hard to unplug it from the device as the grip is small.Sound quality is good but think about the above before you buy.

Sound quality wouldn't disappoint you.. It's superb..The only reason I've given 4 stars instead of 5 stars is for comfort in ear.. I'm not saying that it's uncomfortable ..But it's not that comfortable too.. I can keep it in my ear for around an hour..After that it starts paining..So it's quite difficult for me to watch a full movie continuously with the earphone.. So as far as the comfort issue is concerned, I would say it's okay okay..

Well the built quality is okay but I do not understand why there are so many positive reviews regarding these earphones since there are many others better and cheaper than these however I was fooled by reviews otherwise I would have gone with my Mi basics that are cheaper and much superior to these in terms of sound quality, so do not buy them if you are conscious about sound quality otherwise the built quality is okay of these headphones and I would update my comment after using these for sometime on durability and all

As I have used boat products earlier and never had any problem with quality, I opened and after testing the product once, threw away the box. That was a mistake, only after 1 day of working properly, the speaker volume became very low, even when the volume was full from my end. Through mike worked well, and other person was able to hear me, we could not carry on any conversation. As I did not keep the box, now I am stuck with this non functional product. My sincere suggestion, do not waste your time with buying this. There are several other brands that have wired headset at similar price point.

The product looks very classy in the advertisement. But the actual prodcut is very flimsy and looks very cheap even for Rs 522/- I paid for it. The sound quality is good, bass is very pronounced, not sunding natural. Just 2 days of use. Don't know how long the wires will last as they are very flimsy.Also bought this item thinking that it is a desi product. But later realized that it is made in China, though the company may be owned and operated in India. So it is another chinese knock off in Desi name.

As per the price the earphones feel premium and are of great quality. The audio output is supreme and I love the bass of it. The noise cancellation is okay as such. They feel really sturdy and strong. The pouch given is really helpful in carrying it. We also get extra earplugs in the box which is a really nice touch. It also comes with built in mic and volume buttons which works fab. As per the price I guess it's the best in the segment. JUST GO FOR IT.

Please don't buy this product.There is a problem in production of this earphone.In the beginning you will get a static sound from right side and within some days it will increase.Your microphone will not work properly and will get damage.And your controlling buttons will be stuck.Overall it will not be in a condition to use.And you need to replace it.Even after replacing it you will face the same problem.

Just got the delivery. Wires are way thinner than i thought. Bass and sound are fine. I don't know if it will last long. Hope it does. Joints are also very sensitive. They claim that it's water proof but, the previous version i bought (bassheads 242), went crazy when exposed to a little sweat. So, not gonna take a leap of faith with this one. Will also advice anyone to do the same. Other than that, i am happy that an indian brand is providing such great products.

I got boat earphone thinking the qaulity of these will be marginally more tusting or superior, but i have again been let down.The earphone were working perfectly for only 2-4 days after delivery- this made me think all is well. So I thew away my packaging. Rookie Mistake. DO NOT THROW THE PACKAGING.After the first 4 days the mic completely died. Making me thin something is wrong with my phone or laptop, but not the earphones(AS THEY WERE JUST 4 DAYS OLD!)Anywho now they are lying around in  the house. The only value it adds is maybe the pop of color it brings to my messy drawer in which they lie buried.

If you are a bass lover, this is not for you.Sound quality is good though, But only till 50-60% volume. Dont go beyond that, you will thank me later.I would suggest you to buy boat airdopes 241(Only for bass lovers). They are bit pricey than this one, but are worth it for that price

The quality of the earphones is top notch for the price that you pay.  Fits nicely in my ear. Little uneasy when you wear a helmet. The wired is silicon coated which adds a nice touch and feel.

Boat's earphones are best in their range, no other brand provides such a quality. It's noise cancellation is also pretty good, bass is even good.Particularly this model of earpiece is amazing, as it's of sufficient length, has a clip, mic, and they have provided this very cute tiny Velvet pouch, it's too small of contain that lengthy earphones though.Provides 1 year warranty.So overall it's worth of it's price.

The sound quality is average. Mic is great. If u are more into calls then this one is a better deal because the position of mic is very much where your mouth is not in the middle like most earphones . Its a good product in 300-400 range. Don't buy it if price is more than 400

Its good for a regular user and worth spending.See when u will first time listen with it,u will not feel that much good about the sound quality and thats because u have already been using another headphone/earphone so your ears are used to that headphone/earphone and thats why it takes at least 6-7 days for your ears to grab a new type of vibrations.This is my honest opinion and I swear your ears will feel its real quality after a week.

1)Bass is not their.2)sound quality is not good. quality of sound is cheap as cheaper earphone does3)it's not made for music lovers4)looks funky and cool but not at all comfortable5) for longer period of time if you wear it hurts (more than 30 min)6) the tilt shape near the buds hurt alot only after if you wear more then 30 min7) the louder you increase the volume it pins your ear with only trebal and vocals as like cheaper earphone does.The main thing of this it hurts if you wear more than 30min

This is my 3rd boat hands free and this is the best of them. Bass is amazing and at the same time doesn't hurt your eardrums. Noise cancelation is there and it fits very well. Additional pouch to keep your hands free dirt free is delight (could have been a little bigger though). So 4.7/5 is my experience with this.

Quite an awsome product by boat.Boat always rocks. Its been my favorite product since last 2 years I am using my headphone and now I ordered the wired earphone.Sound quality is good, built quality is also good but the the ear fitting quality which holds the earbuds to the ear is not that up to the marks cuz it hurts after a certain period of time. The only thing which I thought need to mentioned and needed to be replaced by the boat. And on other platforms that quality, sound, bass all are up to the marks.
"

The earphones are amazing. Comfortable to wear, the wire quality is good and bass effects are smooth. The ear hooks prevent the earphones from falling from the ears. Just the problem is with the treble. When you increase the volume the treble exponentially increases and it kind of ruins the experience. But overall the earphones are good and quality of sound is clear and crisp.

I have bought these boat bassheads 242 and the sound output is awesome.I can say this since I've use JBL, Skullcandy, and others in the past.And these really match to the level of others I mentioned above.As far as look is concerned, the look very sporty and amazing.If anyone is considering a wired earphones below Rs 500 and yet expecting quality output, these are your pick for sure.
"

The boat lovers might get offended but to be honest i never got a decent earphone from boat under Rs.2000.And this one is same too , the bass boost is off balance . sound is not pleasant , the earpiece is large and feels uncomfortale , so you cant wear it more than two hours . But in the price range I think it is a applicable product .But if your interested to spend a little more then I would recommend using sony earphones , it will cost to you a little bit more than the boat earphones but it is worth it .

I've been suffering from this earphones problem since long, then my friend suggested me this, I bought it and the experience is soo good, best thing is it's adjusted very well in the ears, and sounds are soo good, I'd recommend to listen ""Light of the seven"" in this earphones. thanks me later.

They're good, sound quality is clear, the base is good not like too much boosted but in the right amount. They fit in ears perfectly and don't fall off. Just the wire connecting earbuds feels thin but it's ok...Edit : after 1 year of use they are still working awesome, although some rats have chewed the wire but still they are working fine after such harsh use and being stretchedEdit 2 : the wires connecting buds are just like clay now, they get cuts out of no where, they have gotten way to soft and weak

Hi, I have purchased the boat earphone recently.The sound quality for this price range is good. The bass is not that much great but okay. If you are using this earphone for smartphone with equaliser, then it is working fine. It cancels the noice and it is okay. The cable quality is good.The microphone for this earphone is not good. It make a bad hissing sound in audio. If your are expecting a high quality earphone for mixing and mastering, then this product is not for you. It is also not good for meeting apps such zm, gm, jm etc etc. As per the price range, this is an okay device.

This earphone is okay in this price range. The base quality is really good and it is very good for gym. It's water resistant too. But I feel a kind of suppression in sounds because base is very high in this earphones. The mic quality is also okay okay....not soo good. And, you can't listen music all the time because after certain time it starts paining in your ears because of it's very hard quality. And yess this is tangle free

Ok so this worked reallly well. The bass was good, the sound quality was good and it was attractive. I bought this on 12th September 2020 and I'm writing on 10th October 2020. It's been around a month or so BUT thereee is some kind of loose connection at the place where the two wires come from and suddenly I can only hear the sound from the left earbud unless I hold in a very specific angle which I obviously can't. Its annoying because I love listening to music and having only 1 side is just GAH. So idk if this will happen to you also but yea

Have replaced so many earphones now, all of them ended up getting their wires cut. This one lasted long, has a coating over the wire hence that problem of wire getting cut is gone. Have used my earphone for more than a year now. Although it is having slight issues now with voice transfer and noises when on call but i am happy with the product. It was worth the money i put into these.

Likes: It's a good value for money.  Good bass, so good for music.Dislikes: can't use for long duration, causes pain in ear due to buds.Since bass is high, hence voice quality for calls is not so good.But over all I say with this price tag it's value for money

I am user of sony xb55 headphone.  So I decided to buy a under 500 Rs headphone.  After research and reading reviews I decided to buy boat 242 headphone which driver is 10 mm and sony xb is 12 mm. Surprisingly the boat have more bass than sony xb.. So you have think why buy a costly headphone. The major difference is that you can listen song uninterruptely with sony xb series but hare you couldn't. With the boat if you listen loudly then you surely irritates by an hour...you can listen low and mid rang with long time..

One of the best products ever introduced by boat.This review is based on 6 months use of this product.Al though it is the first time I have used this model from boat, but I have to admit that I bought it after lots of references from different sources and I wasn't disappointed.It's build quality is flawless; applaud the use of double coated wire with the braided mesh.Sound quality is the best in this price range catagory.Treble and bass is balanced, still you can hear a minor vibration at high volume but it's not that distinguished. It is the side effect of all the long hours I have put in this.

Dont read the reviews, i dont know how, but they dont justify the product for sure, i though every boat earphones are amazing but thats not the case here fr sure.

First of all somehow the headphone jack didn't connect properly in the jack of my phone I had to give it to my brother cuz when I tried to return the earphones they didn't let me return or replace it at that time and it's much weaker that the bassheads 225 it doesn't even have L shaped 3.5mm jack the plastic which is used in this feels cheap compared to the 225 which ironically share the same price most of the times and sometimes even lesser than this

Feels like they have used amplifier. I dare you listen to a song at full volume but at this price point the best earphones you can go for. If you have budget over ₹1.5k you should go for sennheiser with mic but for less than ₹1.5k you won't get better earphones that this. After 3 months of use still works as bought yesterday.

The earphones were very uncomfortable the first time I tried them on but I thought I might get used to it. Turns out comfort was not the only issue with them. I know boAt is known for it's bass but what I didn't know is that it'd be at the expense of a good overall hearing experience. The bass is so high that it actually ends up muffling the dialogues and other sounds. I can see their use in rock music but in a normal movie ? Nope, not the right choice. Also, did I mention that they are not at all comfortable even after a few days of usage ? Anyways, I am going to return them. Hope I get a refund and not a replacement.P.S. - The Samsung original earphones were the BEST.

I am writing this review after using 3 month of this earphone.This earphone has good bass, sound, quality as well as noise cancellation is also good. You are not going to complain about these parameters after buying it.This earphone has sufficient length of wire which will make more comfortable while traveling or jogging.The earphone's earclip is soft and comfortable design in compared to other earphone.At first earclip generates little pain in ears but after using 1-2 week  I am comfortable with it.I got it in 499 rupees. The price of this earphone vary between 450 to 550 during sales.It is better against boat 225 in sound quality, bass.But in compared boat 225 it is not good plated and it not fully matleic (partially Matleic).As well as boat costumer care service is also good.Updated reviewIf the metallic part of earphone (3.5 mm pin cap & earphone joint part) got scratch the whole metallic part will loose the colour like a layer of paint (or like stiker).

Had bought this so that I can use it for running, stopped working in one ear right after a 30 minute run, didn't tug or pull the wire, it was the sweat!!

Try spending a little more and go for better earphones if you want to use them in the gym or while running.

I don't know about others, but personally I didn't liked it. The sound quality is very loud and noisy, I felt irritated after using it for some time. Yes the sound is clear but it's not gentle and you don't feel comfortable while listening to music. I am planning to return it. I felt the treble to be bit more than usual which results in irritation.

1. Bass isn't as good as the BoAt BassHeads 225, and i personally prefer the 225 sound quality better. This seems like a filtered down audio quality, like it might be very so slightly watered down, compared to the rich audio experience of the 225. The difference is minute though.2. The ear hook really makes sure the earphone doesn't slip out due to long duration of usage, is sweat-proof, and is good for a high movement workout (if you can manage the cable)3. Gets tangled pretty easily4. The ear hooks can tend to prick sometimes over long periods of wearing them

I am using this earpiece for last 10 days and I found this one really good. Here are my observations till now.

Not so high not so low.- Noise cancellation works fine.- Cable length and layout is also good.- Ear clip works fine and it make this earphone sporty.

The headphones both speakers are already malfunctioning. I bought on 1st October, there's still 1 month left. The problem began after using for 6 months.

Good noise cancellation, great sound quality and Bass. No complaints regarding the in line mic and controls. Snug fit.I switched from a 162 model to this, in ear support took a day or two to get used to. But, one of the best sounding earphone in this range.

It has been 1 year since im using it! I am a Rough user! I accidentally washed it in Washing Machine! Damn! 🔥 No problems at all! It is still working as if it is newly bought!

i previously owned boat 252, which were amazing and lasted for 2 years with no problem. My usage is extremely less. Diff is the quality is a bit low. wires are too thin. they have sent a small bag along. If you use that bag, the wires will break sooner.2ndly, voice is good. there is treble effect that you can hear. also, the surround tone is on sonit helps with noise cancelling.3rdly, earbuds are made of bad plastic. Not so long lasting.I like it as i lost my other boat and ibwanted to try something new. But eventually, I will buy other boat soon.

So my life was pretty dull before I bought Boat BassHeads 242. I had no girlfriend, no job, but after getting this, life turned around, instantly women started noticing me in public, and I now am dating someone for 5 months. I highly recommend this.

It's really good for bass lovers, it is really bass boosted if you use it with a good sound equaliser i use the realme sound equaliser of the music of realme and the output comes very clear and HD. I don't recommend it for gamers you can play there is not any big problem but you have better options if you are buying for gaming only. This earphone is specially for music and bass lovers.

I like the product initially with the sound quality and the fit but with in a year I was end up in mike issue and some trouble with the one side of speaker. I just try to claim the replacement and mailed to the boat support team. They got the damaged headset from me and they have tracking mechanisms for checking the status of the ticket, issue for their side is they won’t update the status properly to customer and due to covid situation I don’t think they have working technical support team to resolve my ticket. I am really frustrated in following up with them. It’s be more than 3 months and I haven’t got any proper updates. Not even replying via email

Loved this earphone its bass is out standing... build quality is great...if you're getting it for 449... Grab it. It's better than boat 225 and ant w56.. good for jogging.

I'm still using this earphones continuously from last 5-6 months.I have to say its perfectly made finished product in this price range.Sound quality its super crystal clear sound better than its previous basshead model and also mic quality is too good.Bass is perfectly balanced you can say between medium & high level of bass just like previous model.It's build quality is amazing rough & tough.It's wires are tangle free with plastic coating so it too strong 💪.And its also water resistant that is the plus point.And at last its too stylish in look it's complete package in this price range just go for it.

Alright, I used this product for almost a day now...To start of... I love this! 242 is amazing and truly worth it... The bass was something I would never expect for 500 and the quality makes me even more sure that this is definitely more than worth it!Pros: Quality,Bass and a few more items like the clip and the pouchCons: My right ear pains if I use it for like 3 hours or so... PS you can remove the ear hook and it should be fine and that's probably it!

In this price range these earphones are simply awesome. I got boat bassheads 100, bassheads 225 and bassheads 242 and no need to mention bassheads 242 are farr better than these all with a really heavvvy bass and more balanced audio. The comfort of the earphones is incredible and you wont even feel like you  are wearing these on. Ear hooks too come handy with outdoor activities. No need to see any further reviewJUST GO FOR IT.

It gives excellent sound reproduction, cancelling all outside noises. But it does not fit well into the ear. It needs to hook on to the outer ear to fit well. As of now, it keeps falling out constantly. The present hook design is not good.

Product don't meet the quality of advertisement.Uncomfortable in the earProduct shouldn't be called basshead as the bass is not upto standard.Fragile plastic materialHigh frequency elements such as hihats and snares leave that agonizing shrill stinging sound.the low quality of the product has left me astonished, can't believe realme has better earphones in terms of sound quality and material than Boat.

This earphone looks quite ordinary and I also don't think it's cable is tangle free as advertised.  It stays in my ear that's plus in comparison to boat basshead 225 which I had ordered along with this earphone and sound quality is good. Ear hooks are detachable but without ear hooks the tip is uncomfortable in ear so no benefit regarding that. Overall it's okay.

The best product for this price. You may get it for around 400-500. Definitely not worth the mrp cost 1500.Very decent fit and ergonomics.It has volume rockers and play/pause buttons which works on iphone android and also on win pc.A decent sound quality for thr cost.Bass lovers would hate it.Music lovers may not be impressed.But part-time listeners and best suited for callings and meetings.

The earphones are fine as long as working. I had to replace mine after just 2 months as microphone stopped working. And when i had gone to service centre this seemed to be a common problem. Repair person didn’t even check my earphones before giving me new one. That means they are aware about the problem and issue seems to be for larger product batch. Better to avoid this brand. They have money to hire stars/cricketers for marketing but can’t maintain product quality.
"

Bass is missing and it distorts at full volume of a smartphone, if it can't handle full volume means drivers are not powerful enough to deliver good sound and at low volume levels like 1 or 2 from 30 it doesn't give clear audio.Stay away from this, go for Boat 225 you cam feel the bass punch in your ears.

They are what they say - bassheads. But lacks deep bass and mids are low which somewhat loses the true good performance of this. But the clarity is more than its price point. Truly. Beginner sound enthusiasts should try these. Long use will hurt your ears(mine did).

I wanted to purchase an earphone with a decent sound quality and I generally prefer listening to music with high trebble and base. Honestly, this is what I wanted. A perfect product to buy under this price range. In my personal opinion, just dont go for earphones worth 2k-3k, they are waste of money and I bet this earphone gives a tough competition to those expensive craps. This one is more than enough I must say.

Value for money - got myself 2 this time. I love the ear hooks; infact, I have been buying Boat ear phones for quite sometime now - never been disappointed. The ear hooks are a winner; you can't manage a ear phone without the hooks - they are a must to tame the ear phone.

In first impression Sound quality and Bass were excellent at this price point (400₹) and boat had places extra buds of small large size along with medium size attached to earphones and finally a small pocket size bag to place the earphones But delivery speed was pathetic maybe indian post will deliver faster than amazon normal delivery even package handling was worst package was crushed like there is nothing in there but luckily earphones were good and they sounds exceptional

While the product is good, the earlier dispatch was incorrect and later on Amazon replaced it.

It fits perfectly in ear and also looks wise its good. One big problem is that the wire between the ear piece and the connector is very very thin and I am just afraid that it might break anytime so extra care is needed.They say its strong braided wire but its a play... only the wire between connector and joint is thick and strong but that part of wire generally never breaks.So its good in all aspects but the only requirement is for you to handle it with extreme care.

I've been majorly a fan of boat earphones. This is my second earphone (242) after boat 225. Sound quality is superior, bass quality is excellent and I like how these one come with an in ear fitting, though, for longer use I'd recommend to remove them else it might start paining your ears. Quality is fine. I'd appreciate if the mic quality improves a bit. Difficult to talk, at times. Overall 🌟🌟🌟🌟 but a year's warranty compels me to add that one missing 🌟. Thank You for amazing product!

No complaints about my boat's bass heads 242 model except for its Easy Access Controls (or in-line controls) which started malfunctioning on me for whatever reasons. Neither could I regulate the volume with Easy Access Controls nor could I play/pause during media playbacks. This happens most often if not every single time. Also, another malfunction of it being, at times, device fails to recognize the earphones at the time it's plugged in. Overall, I would give it a four star out of five.

The box and freebies might look attractive to any buyer to conceals the flaws of the product. Firstly the boat seal was broken before handing over to me.

I have purchased 163, 225 and 242 bassheads. Sound and quality is worth of buying.

It's ok ok type not a great sound quality, I was using monster earphone that cost me around INR 1500 where sound quality was awesome, look wise it's classy and seem sturdy but sound is quiet loud and not soft as expected. I like soft sounds like Bose, JBL. Ok if budget is INR 500.

One side of the ear phone drop dead n other works very low plus the earphone is making disturbing noises. Don't ever buy this phone. I like to claim my warrenty it will be a great help if amazon help me out with the process.

I bought them in October 2020 and it's march 2022 but still earphones are fantastic (sound and bass) absolutely perfectI have noticed other earphones sound gets degraded over a period of time but these are beyond perfect

I am using it from around 3 months. All I would say is it is worth its price. Value for money. It looks so cool, stylish as the design is very creative and attractive. Durability is very good as its perfomance is same as it was before 3 months, no issues till now. Sound quality is perfect. Noice cancellation also works well. Only issue is it gets tangled.

I have using this for 30 days .. I have a problem in bass , it doesn't support 8D sounds , even my 200rs earphones does !  I can experience only a normal audio.. and also the left earphone was low compared to right ...

Never expected that BOAT would give us such a Bad product. Pricing is not cheap, but the quality is very poor. Within a month or so the product quality deteriorated. The Sound Quality is poor, music gets cut intermittently. Poor product. Not a value for our Money

The earphone is good for calls and decent for music.If you are music lover, go for Sennheiser CX 80.Liked the build quality as it feels strong with clip, mic and volume controls provided.Overall i am happy for the product i got, for the price i paid.

Worst product ever ... its sound quality is very bad and some time only one earpiece is working and even its not comfortable in ears and something is wrong with the mic its not working ..dont go for this product .. amazon should give me option to order some different product as i exchanged it once and the same problem is there .. i want some different product ..
"

I used them for quite long time andSound Quality is good butDurability is average, the wire get stretched easily, A simple can lead to not working of your earphone.But I get them replaced with a great service of the company.(You just need to go to there website and register your complain with the product invoice.. they will pick your product at your door step)But the mice of the replaced product stopped working after some time.

It works fine and good for 6-8 months...I have purchased almost 3-4 pieces from past 2-3 years... After using it for 6-8 months either the left earphone stops working or else the right one similarly....If you're looking for earphones for less than 1 year life and not too costly... Go for this...
"
1630,"
These earphones have a legit bass driver and can deliver a clear and balanced output. They might not be the most comfortable ones due to a cheeky design attempt by the ""BOAT Team"" who for some reason could not keep it simple. Maybe they were supposed to look cool or something. Still if you listen to music for like about 2 hours a day then you could go for these. However, If you are an extreme audiophile and have your earphones plugged in for the major part of the day then these are not for you.
"

It is the best one and the most stylish looking.Here are some pros and consproIt is very useful for online classes as the quality and noise cancellation is awesome.It has a very beautiful design.ConA Bit uncomfortable maybe???Result:-You can buy it(Review after 8 months)

The product looks cheap with that design unlike how it looks in images. The cord/cable/wire is semi strong unlike it's competitors.Bass is ok. Not recommended if you are someone who likes soft music.Go for 255 it's atill the best!Had Terrible experience with Amazon for getting it refunded!

I have boat rockerz 510 and boat bassheads 225 as well but i needed one more so i ordered this boat bassheads 242..In terms of audio quality i am very much impressed.But in terms of build quality it is far behind than boat 225 and microphone performance is also poor.Button also does not work sometimes. But pricing is value for money.

I got the product in offer at prize of ~380₹ so its Best with this prize. Boat is always known for sound quality so I got the same experience. Also Ear ergonomics is best suited and tight.

It was ok for a week or we are unable to identify the noise issue, it started giving abnormal noise once connected to phone, quite unhappy now the return period is also over need to live with it or scrap it
"

The sound quality very imbalanced and not good at all. But should I complain, it does what its name says... makes you a ""bass head"". The mic is not up to the mark either, I have to constantly hold it in front my mouth and if its just dangling, the other person gets noise and can't hear me at all. Even ears start paining even after half an hour of use.
"

Sound quality is good. Noise cancellation feature is also good.Earphone filter quality is bad. it'll remove after sometimes.Two times i replaced my earphone due to internal wire problem.wire quality is also an issue.  one time left side earphone not worked and this time mic issue.only reason i purchased this, brand name and sound quality.

I am happy with the earphone design as it just fits right into my ears. I am sad about the quality of plastic that is used as a little piece chipped off within 1 week of use.I don't know how other earphones are as these are the most expensive earphones I have purchases/used. I feel that the microphone isn't that great it has a bit of static noise and sometime the music plays too loudly.

It's very bad that the mic is always getting fault, this is my second headset in the same brand facing the same issue on both. Claiming a warranty is a very tedious process, I have been trying to reach the support team but they have closed my ticket without solving my issue. Worst experience ever with this product.
"
1647,"
See main thing is overall product is pretty nice and durable. It's good looking and the design is attractive. But the sound quality is not up to the mark. The sound quality is really good while playing games. But during video calls it isn't that clear. Noise cancelation is standard, equal to the earphones of this category and is pretty cool in accordance to price. Bass quality is awesome. No problem at all in any type of music.
"

Sound quality is good. 3.5 mm pin is NOT angular. Had it been angular say with 90 degree, it would have been more convenient to use. Cannot comment right now on durability of cable. Overall product is good.

Best product in this range.Below 1000 earphone range BOAT  is the best product in this range. Well balanced sound. Nice bass. I really like the bass quality of this earphone.

I have been using it for three months and now it doesn't play audio out of one ear .the build quality is very poor that the wires are already  broken and been pulled out from the head. they provide a warranty period of one year but unfortunately I lost the warranty card now I seriously have no idea what to do with it. A reputed brand like boat shouldn't manufacture these kind of cheap quality product and ruin its prominence.

Used it for more than a year.The quality is great and crisp. It has less bass as compared to basehead 225 but definitely takes upper hand in noise cancellation and quality.Trust me guyz you will love this one.Obviously better than basehead 225.(just a little less bass as compared to 225.But you wont even need that bass because the sound quality is that good).

After almost 30 days of use I can say that this earphone is very confortable for the ears even after hours of usage.

The only thing about wired headphones I don't like is it's not that durable !. My bassheads only worked for 2 months after buying the product . I'm not satisfied with the price of something like this if it's not so durable . 2 months later one of the ear bud weren't working and mic too.
"

I have purchased this earphones with the hope that it will be durable as their Marketing team claimed it to be durable. After few months of use suddenly it broke from connector side and it stopped working. Cheap quality materials are used to make it seem like durable. Never buy earphones from Boat, cheap chinese built products!!!
"
1669,"
Everything is okay, not much expected, but i am really scared that this won't work for a long time because the earphones I received, the jack which you insert in the phone THAT WAS A BIT BENDED and that's the most reason all the earphones get damage. Let's see hope for the best, and yeah the bass was over very much, bass in these earphones are filled like garbage XD. As usual not much expected. "" So Far So GOOD. :)

The earphones are going smooth till now 1 week passed and till now no issue came by these earphones sound quality is Nice VERY useful for sports loving persons VERY comfortable and strong earphones but one thing is bad in this your ear will start paining if you will be going to use these for more then 3-4 hours just because the earphones manage itself like that no air or no outer sound comes in our ear and only the inner sound comes which leads to pain in our ears . Rest all the things are fine till now .Thank you .

The worst decision of my life to purchase this item, and another thing is the worst customer service by boat company who not at all listening of their customers (can find many complaints against it in Google) Mr Smit Kadam from boat company is the DEVIL of all.

As soon as u plugin the earphones one thing which U realize is that treble is good but as far as bass is concerned it is nowhere. At High volumes it has much of a noise so suitable for lower volumes.

good product n but it started to have a problem of no sound in one earphone then when you adjust the jack then works it was fine till 2 days then started having this problem not great for this much price the jbl one is the same price and the overall quality sound everything is just perfect I say don't buy BoAt products this my 2nd BoAt product and I'm not at all satisfied :(

these earphones have a lot of issues.first, the volume range in which they effectively work is quite small. outside that the sound quality drops drastically.then, they have a weird background buzz like old earphones used to have. like old earphones, these make noise even when we scroll mouse.the mic isn't that good.earphones are uncomfortable.

Good sound quality but not so comfortable inside ears. Not for long period of use.Update: product stopped working within 2 months or so had mic and Jack issues, sent for replacement but of no use it's been 23 days the replacement unit has not been dispatched.

 Sound the quality  is amazing , it's just the design of the earbud is bit uncomfortable, as boats 225 fit perfectly in ears. The noise cancelation is good, even over the calls.I had issue only with the packing of the product. At first I felt someone has already opened it and used.

Sounds great, mic is good, buttons are really clicky which is good but, there's a big BUT, the noise cancellers on the top of each bud are so hard that they make your ear lobes ache during long usage.Small Solution: you can exchange the noise cancellers, switching the right one for the left one and vice versa. This will minimize the pain till you get used to it.

Sound quality is good, although sometimes it may feel unbalanced.

The worst earpiece i have bought so far.Honestly after looking the reviews,i was hoping it would be fine.but the sound was soo...unclear and it makes the music worst.Therefore, the sound quality is worst while others are fine .Its just a waste of money comparing to the product.A 100 worth chinese earpiece gives more good sound than this product.please dont buy it.U will regret.

Buy it if you love bass.The sound quality is pretty good.The clips are harmless.Causes a bit of pain during the initial days but you'll get used to it.sometimes the bass overweighs the vocal quality but it doesn't seem as an issue as we can adjust it with the help of equaliser.The mic is doing a great job.Produces a great sound by the way.Its more than enough if you keep the volume to 70%...All around good earphones but I would still recommend you to buy JBL for better quality..

Good sound in this price range. Using it from ladt 6 months. Looks great, good bass, clarity of sound may not meet your expectations on high volume.Good for PUBG or movies.Not recommended for long time use.

Well it's really a great product.But if u have habit to put wire in ur mouth then idk how but the wire changes colour from black to white.Overall the are good. For more good quality u might need to adjust your phone sound settings.Bass is good in this price.Comfort is ok not that much good but it wont be a problem with time.You can remove ear hooks according to ur comfort.

This has the best audio quality among all other earphones under ₹400. The bass is not too high and just perfect. The band is a bit sticky and may get tangled, but the sound quality more than makes up for it. Overall, very happy with the product.

I like the product. It is worth for the price I paid. Previously I was using mi headset in this price range, since i am using it for a year , I changed to this product, I dont feel much bass and sound quality, i think it is because i am using MOTO.I should try in some other mobiles in order to check the sound quality.Previously I was dissatisfied with amazon for providing wrong product, But now they delivered it on correct time and correct product.I would like to suggest amazon to make their app more user friendly like flipkartThanks.

Please don't not buy this product atleast from Amazon. I have never faced this issue from other websites from this product stopped working and getting weird noises in between any music or call.

Been using this for a month. I know it's not a long time but so far it's great. One thing I don't like is the shape of the earpiece. You can't just normally insert that thing in your ear. It requires a few couple seconds of fidgeting, each ear, in order for it to properly sit in your ear
"
1731,"
I will not bore you with a long review. In short, the sound quality and bass quality is so good that it will compensate for any other demerits you might find about the earphones.Although, I don't think there are any significant cons considering its cost and quality. Fit and comfort is also perfect. Surprisingly, the wings are also useful.

I bought 2 of these at a 1 week interval. The first one, for my friend, produces static noise everytime the jack is turned and also, the microphone is not working when connected to a laptop.

I have been using these earphones with my Moto e⁷ Power Android 10 version for the past one month. The sound quality, noise cancellation and bass results are superb. I am fully satisfied with the product because it feels fantastic when one using it. In my view, it's a good value for the price paid.

For a person who uses earphones almost 24/7 , it is really comfortable. sometimes i even forgot i was wearing it cuz usually if we wear any ear phones for a long time it will eventually lead to some discomfort but in this case , there is nothing of such sort. i would really love to talk its beautiful color, I am a neon lover and i fell in love the moment i saw it . If you are a neon lover and wants some color instead of the basic black ones, then go for this one

The earphones have good sound quality, fit comfortably inside your ears, and stay there even if there's sweating, and never caused any irritation even after 3-4 hours of continuous use.

the bass of the sound is good when I turn the volume to the fullest, but the other pitched tune rather than the bass are unbearable.

This headphone is excellent in terms of the sound quality and bass particularly when listening to music in youtube etc.. The build quality is very good and its perfectly fit the ear. However I found that quality of the microphone is poor based on the feedback from the receivers end.

Although sound quality is damn good but i personally can't use it for hours of music listening and gaming,it starts hurting my ears after an hour or few.

They've the best grip , the best bass , and the best microphone u can ever get from an earphone in this budget , it's loud and clear and the microphone being at the right earphone makes it closer to ur mouth which gives a better clearity of ur voiceThe bass is too good for a mobile user and me being a student who has class and plays and listens to songs on an earphone, I loved these

Best for bass lovers, built quality is decent enough for the price but they could've done better the glossy plastic case kind of feels cheap and gets scratches and the jack could've been a l-shaped one which ruins their pretty tough rugged wire claim vain.Verdict - at this price point it is the best you can get but they could've done better

you cannot expect more from this price range,the jbl or other earphones do offer the same build quality.The sound is good..base is good as well,the rubber support works well.Wire length is unexpectedly long .If you are looking in something for the price range of 500 or 600 this works well and compared to other products of this range,this js somewhat similar in sound build quality, although the music is satisfactory ,highs and lows are clear enough to enjoy any song.

Entirely braided with kevlar this earphone comes with a aluminium/stainless stell mesh.It is totally tangle free in most of the situations.Carry pouch felt a little smaller for its accomodation.It works as a charm on my Xiaomi Poco X3😎.Well pronounced trebles and extremely high bass (more than realme buds 2 even after 10 mm drivers).Dolby Atmos adds the difference!

At first I started to not like it for its bright color but suddenly my mind changed and it forced me to keep it to me with its performance. Very good bass and sound quality, the bass is a bit better than 225, and the quality of sound is equal to 225. I liked it it's very satisfying and lightweight which ensures your comfortability. If it hurts your ears don't forget to remove the hooks and make yourself comfortable.

Not as expected. Sound quality is good but not feeling surrounding sound much more only bass is over boosted. Feeling headache after 1 hour listening of songs. You can use its volume to 50% for its good sound effect. I suggest to don't buy it. You can go for remax 512 for best sound effect. And bought it in INR 649 after a it's available for INR 499 why????

Noise cancellation happens, but worst with additional notice from Headphones.Buttons and Controls do not work at all. Neither the Microphone and its controls nor the Volume buttons work.Highly suspicious on the used product which may have been returned by someone. Highly disappointing service.

Its a great deal for 499 Rs., as always boat gives you good products. Mostly incomparable price and quality is what they seek. The 242 series is like a bundle of joy within a economic range. The sound is good the balance between bass and treble along with mids and highs are great. Instead of saying noice cancellation I would like to call it a nice noise isolating earphone. ""Plug in to feel the beats...""

The only thing that I personally like about this product is the quality it provides..but when I come to built quality it should be somewhat strong enough to be used for longer period of time....""Realme buds 2"" is really far better option.. *not a brand pramotion it's an honest review

It has a sort of coating along with a clip that's supposed to keep tangles to a minimum but it's hard to say how much difference it will make in the long run. Would have preferred it if it were braided instead, but other than that it's prrtty decent in other areas

Sound, noise cancelling, bass all features are quite good then it's own 225 model.I recieved the package open at the time of delivery.

I don't like this product and the main reason behind this, cz product quality & sound quality of this product is not like actual brand boat quality, It is like worst product sound is not clear and the body of this product is not good and the conclusion is WASTE OF MONEY, If you want to waste your money then you can purchase.

Boat is doing really good in terms of manufacturing earphones. The sound quality and base will definitely impress you if you are into listening loud music.

Boat basshead 450 has very clear sound and bass is also good.Many comparison videos on youtube says that boat 225 has better bass than 242 it is true because i also had 225.

If you did not compare both earphone together you will not find any difference.Overall 242 has nice sound quality and bass. You can buy it.

So I bought this product because i need a cheap earphone giving a good experience on my PS4. I was really satisfied with these earphones, Bass is next level, sound quality is absolutely OK’ish/really good, as the earphones are completely covering your ear, there is a fair amount of noise cancellation. Best experience is listening to music. For me, for this price these earphones are good for gaming and music and other internet surfing.

Almost like Senheiser within good rate. It's sound is better when you listen to music even when you minimize it's volume, except for it's bass. It's sound quality is also good on audio calls on any app. It also does look stylish with the type of earbuds it has got which fits well on ears.

Its overall a good quality earphone, more bass than treble. If your criteria is bass then go for the 220, I felt I downgraded myself switching from 220 to 240.The 220 has metal buds which feel premium while this is plastic and feels cheap, also the 220 has a right angled headphone jack which makes it sturdy and good for long time use, the 242 doesn't

Has a crispy soud quality. Good for melodious romantic songs. Adequate bass. But the quality of the bass could be improved. Good built quality but wire would have been better. Such wire may be tangle free but does not lasts long. Most import thing is the position of in line mic and volume control wich is not available in most of the products at even higher prices.

I have used Boat 100 bassheads and even Boat  450 headphones. I absolutely loved the Boat sound but these headphones were a disappointment that I had to return them. There was very minimal bass and sound clarity was like the earphones u get inside a flight. I had to get these cause the boat 450 broke blame it on plastic build quality and the Boat 100 stopped working. But I would pick the Boat 100 anytime if you want a good budget earphone.

Great earphone at this price range.Pros: Wire has some coating over it which is great. Bass is good. It has volume & next buttons. Earbud is small in size which fits verywell in ears and doesn't come out like my earlier basshead 225.Cons: You can NOT hear song at full volume since it has loud sound, but it can be avoided by hearing at less volume.Overall i liked it and worth to buy.

Quality is super noise is louder, bass quality is excellent. Also call quality is excellent. 60-70%sound is enough loud. Only drawback is it hurts after 2-2.5 hours of use and it's not tangle free cabel. I will give three Star for its design otherwise quality is excellent

I have purchased it on December but it stopped working on May. But using 1year warranty , boat replaced the damage produect with a new same earphone by door to door delivery. I didn't spend any money for claiming my warranty. Besides sound is very nice and heavy . I am enjoying. Thanks boAt.

 Earphone seems like it already used by someone as u can see in pictures its earphone connector is tilted and product packaging is very very rubish & poor.This is NOT expected from Amazon .& Second time after replacing item its not support my device realme 8 5G.

Fell for the color at once but i was paranoid about the in-ear extensions. I read a couple of reviews which said that it can be uncomfortable while lying down but they are removable and the earphones can be used as regular earphones while not working out or running.The bass is obviously very good as the name suggests. Mic is sensitive enough. Sound is crisp and clear.I think its a good choice for the price range. (Got it for 500 INR)

I purchased this product in April 2021 with one year warranty.... but its been only 8-9 months these are giving some serious problems..... m not able to take calls or not even able to listen music.... headphones will stop responding in between calls and volume will increase and decrease on its own...

I am using this headphone 🎧 for more than 3 months and I am happy of it's specs. In the beginning my ears have a pain due to the large hooks even though it is made up of soft material and after a month of usage I was used to it and I didn't have any pain. The next this is it's sound quality is very outstanding and I love to hear sounds with this and it's bass quality is also good.
"

When you're in closed room than you can feel the bass, but when you're on the go driving or outside you won't get that bass as outside noise would make loud music down. For those who like loud music this is not the one you're searching for;This can be used for calling or daily use but not for music lovers.

Not satisfied with the product. Guys I suggest you to buy the old boat 225 they are much better. If you are a pro equalizer use then the best Boult audio bass buds are best (oak wood model) it has inbuilt sub woofers.  These are just okay, too much treble

Bass is super low, it can be only heard on full volumes, and listing on full volumes can be bad since the earphones are pretty loud.In build quality on the main wire is of very good quality, but the rest of the build is quite bad.overall its fine for the price but dont justifies the name basshead.

One of the earphones. Compared to bassheads 225/220, the only pro that 225 has is L shape connector and the ear tips that you get is not that great. In other scenarios, it's comforting, slightly better sound and good fit.Wait for some day, when it is priced at 400, buy it.

I bought this pair of earphones about three months ago and already the one of the sides has stopped working. While the buttons work, there is no sound in the right side. The sound quality is good but it is packaged in a product that breaks down in less than 6 months. Would not recommend unless you can get it heavily discounted.

This is a review after 1 year after the warranty is over (Purchased in Sep 2020).The earphone was outstanding throughout in all the areas (Bass, Mic, Stereo); However after an year, one side of the earphone is not working anymore. As one can expect it to occur from China manufacturers.

I used it for listening to Music, Movies and phone conversations.Music sounds plain in it, it sounds dull and pathetic,Movie experience is horrible as well.Phone conversations are worse. The person on the other side is hearing 'static' / 'buzz' voice since I received this feeble piece of technology.

Why anyone buys a Bluetooth earphone?... So that they can do their work freely while having earphone on. Imagine the voice continuously breaking while you have that plugged into your ears listening to your favorite song.I assure that is one of the most annoying thing you can experience.This is the only issue with the phone...if you are stationary, all ok...In a straight line without anything inbetween the range is 4-5 Metres.Don't even think of jogging with this product.I am editing my comment further after a months use, the connection issue is really troublesome.Even when stationery, it keeps on disconnecting.If your hand comes between the phone and earphone, the voice breaks completely.Never seen anything like that in any wireless earphone before.

Two major issues: 1) Bluetooth connection stability: this device connects instantly but while on the move the audio is constantly  interrupted. Even if I  keep my hand on the pocket the phone is kept, it interrupts audio (while walking). And not only for few seconds, but it keep on interrupting through out my walk. If I'm using it with the phone in front of me it's awesome, but not at all good while walking.2) Direction of sound: It lacks a very fundamental concept of direction of sound. Left earpiece produces sound coming from right and vice versa. First I had doubt, while playing game. Later on checked using 5d sound test and now confirmed that both earpiece produces sound coming from opposite direction. Left earpiece produces sound coming from right and Right earpiece produces sound coming from left.Used this device for approximately a week.I am writing this review after I placed a replace request. I would try the replaced set and if the issue remains same, I would like a refund.Received the replacement and found same issue with the replaced set too.Update: I requested a refund of the replaced product.

The best part about this product was the ease it brought in my life. I literally wore it entire day and even during workout as it settles down around the neck quite easily.The battery backup has been good so far in 3 months of usage. 12+ hours of usage in one full charge. Looks decent, not very premium but sturdy and is comfortable to wear. Fits snugly in the ear. The sound quality is clear and crisp.About the cons, it is not really for an audiophile as it has hardly any bass. Noise cancellation could have been better but it is still decent. As many have mentioned, the connection gets distorted in a crowd or when I move 10+ feet away from the phone.Edit - The ear plug on the left side has come out after 2 months of use and they have not given any replacement. Recently I have discovered that the after sales support for this product is non-existent. The customer care helpline never responds and I have called 100 times. Don't buy because there is no credibility in the brand. It is like any other local produce and warranty means nothing. Risky proposition!

Totally I have 4 device's of same within my family and friends. This is really outstanding headset I had ever had .... Must have for all . Best in class 👌January update -I have been using the bluetooth device from 2 days . I haven't charged and used for about an 7-8hrs that's great for any device for me till now ..Little bit doubtful on durability and built quality apart from that I haven't found anything yet to say it as con's .But it's really helpful if you buying this for calls and music it is good to hear from the small ND awesome ear pieces...Totally budget gadget in decent price with awesome performance 👌

The best part about this product was the ease it brought in my life. I literally wore it entire day and even during workout as it settles down around the neck quite easily.The battery backup has been good so far in 3 months of usage. 12+ hours of usage in one full charge. Looks decent, not very premium but sturdy and is comfortable to wear. Fits snugly in the ear. The sound quality is clear and crisp.About the cons, it is not really for an audiophile as it has hardly any bass. Noise cancellation could have been better but it is still decent. As many have mentioned, the connection gets distorted in a crowd or when I move 10+ feet away from the phone.Edit - The ear plug on the left side has come out after 2 months of use and they have not given any replacement. Recently I have discovered that the after sales support for this product is non-existent. The customer care helpline never responds and I have called 100 times. Don't buy because there is no credibility in the brand. It is like any other local produce and warranty means nothing. Risky proposition!

Excellent product... I was never expecting this premium quality headset with this price segment..Design and build quality:- looks are very premium and light when you wear it. Its very much flexible  and buttons are well responsive.""Sound quality"":- really sound quality was very impressive and clear ...bass is great but not the best... it's very loud if you hear it with 100% volume...but for better experience use it 50-60% volumeBattery life :- coming to battery  it's really great...it will last upto 6-7hrs if you listen it with 60-70% volume... charging time is around 1hr 40minsConnectivity is fine within 15ft distance..Finally it's really good ""value for money"" if you're interested go for it without wasting time... thumbs up Boult curve 👌👌👍

I've been using it from weeks now and I think now is the time to give a review. I can tell you this that only weight you feel on your ears is of the sound of music, it is light as feather and battery life is amazing (I used it for more than 12 hours (5,6 hours ideal). Sound quality is good and I mostly use this for multiple devices and with my laptop it feels like its the best fit than wireheadphones. And for the price they are offering,  this can't get any better. I'll recommend this product.

I have owned and currently own a lot of good speakers, headphones and earphones. My previous Bluetooth earphones suddenly stopped working and i was seeing a lot of ads by boult and so i decided to give them a try. The first pair i bought sounded better however had a problem where the Bluetooth would stop for a second and resume on its own automatically and so i got a replacement today. The second pair while doesnt have any problems, they do sound terrible. The audio quality is nowhere near the competition and they have no bass at all. The audio is very high pitched for some reason. The only good thing about the earphones is the build. While the durability is a bit flimsy the design is good. Wouldnt recommend buying them though.

Just checked these earphones, Here are few points that i want to make so that buyers doesn't get fooled by discount.1.Over priced2.inflated MRP to lure people by giving huge discount.3. I didn't like bluetooth connectivity, as sound drops even if you are 5 feet away from phone4. Plastic used is so cheap, doesn't feel like 4500/- earphones5. Wire of both buds is so thin, it seems very fragile, hope it doesn't get in hands of children otherwise surely you will regret it.6. Sound quality is not that adequate, i have wired jbl earphones which i bought for just 700 are way better than this.Suggestion for makers, don't play cheap gimmicks to sell stuff by inflating MRP and than giving big discount, you could have done better than this.I got trapped in discount. Hope others will not make same mistake as i did.Have a good day.

Don't know, who is giving a 5-star rating. Fooling peoples. managed reviews.I never write so bad review of any product if it just OK.But this is the worst.Worst connectivity issue.Even if you don't move, even if you are watching the movie on PC form mere 1-foot distance, still it stutters. The issue in connectivity. You can't imagine when you are riding on a bike or you are moving or jogging. Third class connectivity. When there is such problem, what is the use of all that Music quality and durability?Simple logic is, do not buy. Go for a branded product of instead there are Zoook in same price point.

This product has quiet balanced sound in terms treble and bass and has good noise isolation.Battery life is good and currently using for last 6 hours continuously and has not lasted still.I am a big bass lover and need little more enhanced bass for my requirements, but this one has balanced one.I hope this review will help for your purchase.

I will tell you my experience of 60 daysFor sound quality: No doubt .. it's good but when it comes to grip around neck.. it's very irritating sometimes. initially the range was good but late ri noticed that when i listen music while walking..continous disturbanxe will be there.. Also one most negative impacy is ..you can't bplay PUBG wearing it lol...sound comes little bit late..So i will say, if your budget is tigt this is much better optionbattery and charging wise it's average..not bad neither too good..but very decent.After 1 year of use I will say if you want to buy it better go for true wireless ones as this one will cause problem as having neck  band has its own disadvantages and its range is also reduced compare  to prior.

Hi,I wish if I could give it a 0 star.Pros: Amazon Deliver  Good Sound Quality  Battery BackupCons : Blue Tooth Connectivy  Pathetic Call QualityThe most important part neglected in the design in Bluetooth connectivity. I tried both with my Samsung and Mi phones.If phone is in your pocket and you are working out then Bluetooth will disconnect intermittently. Moreover, you will notice a lag of 2 seconds on a call.I am not able to return the product but I have an option of replacement. Replacement I don't want because other reviews also tells the same story. All in All, please do not buy.

Updated review after using it for working out:Whilst using the headphones during jogging and working out, noted that there was a lot of jitter/break in the sound and also the earphones kept coming out. Tried changing the earbuds but was not of much use. Hence reverting to my older wired BoAT headphonesDecent pair of headphones. Was able to pair to my Moto Z Play without much fuss and was fairly straightforward. Music playback is decent - bass is OK and not exceptional. Call quality is OK. Have not yet tried out the headphones while jogging or working out and hence unsure as to how they would behave when subject to constant movement and vibration. Not yet assessed battery life either

Product sound and battery life is awesome. here i am giving 1 star because my needs not fulfilled by this product. i brought this specially for running and walking but this product connectivity issue is very worst. if we put mobile in pocket then connectivity issues get started. also vibration voice is really irritating .Device cover only 4 to 5 ft of range only. if any disturbance come between this then sound quality affected.I like product design, sound and specially Bass effect is mindblowing, battery life is also gud.Suggestion : Boult should work on bluetooth connectivity issue.

Returning the product just after use of. 5 hours.The sound quality is good but the earplugs are pretty uncomfortable.The battery life is good but the quality of the band is not upto the price.The quality of the Bluetooth connection is very poor.  It couldnot even withstand the 2 mtr space. Between phone n earphones.The quality of the packaging was poor it was all messed up. Please do not buy this product its not worth wasting your money.  The mai point of returning this product is uncomfortable earplugs & very very poor Bluetooth connection.

I received a damaged product. The outer cover was scratched. I opened with hope that it would be worth spending Rs.1300 but as i opened the box i found it very dusty. Metallic earpiece was scratched. It appeared like a local product. Very cheap quality. sound was also breaking with 1 side. I didn't find any option of replacement so i am returning it. Plz do not believe blindly on reviews.

The product stopped working after six months. When I tried contacting the service center for registering a complaint firstly they never pick our calls. And then they asked me to send the product with all its accessories. So I did. They took more than two weeks just to process my product. Since my device was still in warranty I asked them to provide a replacement but they provided me with refurbished device and that too without any of my accessories. This refurbished device has a very bad sound quality, low battery life. Now they are not at all replying to  any of my queries.I recommend not to buy this worst product.

Not Satisfied..I hardly used it 2-3 times and the battery is not charging. I charged it for 2-3 hours but battery is still 40%. Tried another charger and cable still the same. Even though it shows red light for charging but it doesn't charge over 40%. Really disappointed. The return window on amazon closed just 3 days ago. It has just been 15 days since I got the delivery..waste of money. I don't know what to do and how to claim warranty.

Not a good product as expected after viewing the details and performance comparison.Bluetooth is not having good connectivitySound quality is good but only when mobile is in your hand.Connectivity is not good when mobile is in your pocket or 5 feet away from the gadget.You can not do the running or jogging while using this, connectivity issues are their if you are just walking or even little movement can crack the voice or sound ....Auto disconnecte some time during activity like exercise or yoga.......  Not solve the purpose

Highly advertised below average product for the price.Sound quality is average , no great grip on ears especially if your are working out in gyms or thread mills.Sound breaks when there are some obstacles between mobile and headset,quite annoying in gym environment.Call sometimes break although can be managed.Battery backup is pretty average.Worst thing is customer care is pathetic.No response for tickets raised ,even after 10-15 days!!!! They call you as soon as you register the product for warranty and requests for 5 star rating and offer you some rewards and after that you will ignored !

Although the sound is good but the product is extremely unreliable and non durable. It keeps getting disconnected continuously after every 5 seconds. The Bluetooth range is also extremely poor.At this price its a waste of money.The worst part being that when you try to return this it only gives you the option of replacement and not refund. This is just a horrible strategy to force customers to use such poor products.

Edited 29.07.20I wrote to Support on the Boult website. I got a call asking me to delete this review. They asked me to send it for repair, which I sent at my own expense, enclosing the extra ear protectors and the charging cable. After a week I got the piece back, but without a charging cable or the extra ear protectors. I've plugged it in to charge using my own cables, it is not charging. The LED light does not turn on, nor does the piece work. I do not know what they are trying to do.Initial review:As far as the sound quality was concerned, this was fine. I'm not interested in bass and things like that so I cannot comment.The product came to me in a resealed box and without the one page manual. However, it worked after I charged it so I didn't complain. Last night I connected it to my laptop to charge.This morning I tried switching it on. After the voice saying ""Power on"", there was a sparking sound and now it is dead and does not turn on. When I plug it in there is no LED light.I'm very disappointed.

The product I received had huge problems with bluetooth connectivity. The range said in the product description is 10m. Well... It didn't even connect properly in 4m range. Even for the slightest movements of the headset, there were disconnection/brake in audio. I don't know if my product is alone like this or it is the general case. There wasn't an option to return. Hence, I have requested a replacement. I will update my review once i receive the replacement. Till then i wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this.EDIT: The replacement arrived. No improvement. In fact, now it has physical damage. Now returning it.

This is not good for talking on phone, it has good speaker but bad mic. Noise cancellation is bad, so not good while talking on mobile.

Purchased this headset after looking at all the positive reviews. It lived up to the expectations with good sound and bass quality & batter power (5+ hours). All these were short lived, within a month of usage it stopped charging properly. While charging it would turn to blue very quickly (30+ minutes) and if you remove from charging it would hold charge for few minutes and Bluetooth gets disconnected.Since the return period is over, reached out to Boult based on the 1 year warranty provided. They suggested to raise a ticket and then to send the faulty product to a New Delhi address. Its been couple of weeks, waiting with fingers crossed to get an update. Its a bit frustrating and not sure whether anyone wants to be in this state after spending good amount for the head set.Update : Got the new one nearly after a month of follow ups. The returned one also is a refurbished one and stopped working within a week. Again the cycle of returning and getting back started. Lot of time and effort wasted. The third product also stopped working within a month. Its not worth to spend this much time and effort and so stopped chasing Boult.May this company is not for me. Will not buy any Boult products anymore.

Alert Alert AlertAfter sale service is sooo pathetic even more when one have to bear the cost to put it on course to service centre.If they don't listen you easily than use twitter handle......When you don't get proper after sale service than it is better to drop it outAfter almost 9 month of purchase I am writing this review.The sound is good even bass but need to change your sound setting manually , if u use it continuously it gives you 5 to 6 hour play, battery plays a good role, flexible, easy to fit.The bad thing is its got faulty two times and we need to send it back to the customer centre, u have no access at the service station, after submission, you will get it repaired (not replaced) and they will send it back at per your complain form address.Got it repaired for the third time but still not working.Had to bear the sending cost to the service centre.It's so irritating having regard to the competency of the service centre.

I felt this neckband was good in all aspects, sound quality bass even on full volume, call quality perfect noise isolation during calls, comfortablity is awesome can sleep on side ways without any uncomfort while wearing it, never seen this in any kind of earphones. But the reason for giving a single star or may be 0 star is because of the button qualities. Button quality was too poor, clumsy feel , feel like it will stop working any moment, not responding to power on or off properly, had to try 7-10 times to power it on. Some times powers off if we try to reduces the volume or increase the volume. Felt pathetic with this kind of button controlles. Missed few calls due to the irresponsiveness of button, it used to disconnect and switch off when we try to receive the call. Finally made up mind to return it. Thanks to Amazon's 14 days return policy

I bought this product because of overall good reviews. Sound quality was average. For first 2-3 weeks, it was working fine. But one ear stopped working after that. And now it’s not even switching on.

Huge let down. Im mot sure about the reviews by other friends on this product. The sound quality never differentiate the high low and bass. The freesolo which i bought earlier was amazing i could have bought the same and comes a tad cheaper. For a bluetooth headphone i reckon its better to invest a little more and get a good one. They dont entertain refunds. There is an exchange that u can do and doesnt really help since u get the same damn product. Battery got pathetic after a months use. After i full charge it comes for 1 hr and durability is just ok.

Do not buy any Boult product, I had purchased it in October and one of the earplugs stopped working. Their customer service is pathetic and very lazy in providing response. Also, you'll have to bear all the cost to send the product to their warehouse for exchange.It says it has microwoofers, however the bass quality is quite poor, at par when compared to any other earphones on the market.Overall Sound quality is average. Instrument separation is poor, treble is unnecessarily high. You just can't tolerate full volume for any vocal song. There's no balance in sound quality.Battery lasts for 9-10 hours.Only good thing about this product is light weight.In ear fit is good. Noise cancellation is decent.Do not buy if it costs you for more than 800 rs.

Fake warranty card provided in box.3.

Fault product was received . It stopped working within a month of purchase . I was hardly able to use it once or twice . The device discharged within half an hour of use . I tried calling customer support since it comes with one year warranty  but on selecting new complaint the call automatically gets disconnected . I emailed on the support id provided on amazon , but did not receive any response . It turned out to be a complete waste of money .There was warranty of 1 year with the device . I had to pay 350 shipping to dispatch the device to Noida. They send a replacement which is again faulty and doesn’t pair with any laptops . So I basically ended up Spending even more on shipping to receive a replacement that doesn’t work either .

I had bought this in Jan 2019. If you are lucky, your neck band will work as mine for about 8 months. I used it very very carefully. Still since monday this left side earphone is not working. Tried contacting bould audio thru various means but failed to get a response from them. They say that the product would be replaced under warranty. But who would give you that replacement product since you will not get any response from their service centre or their customer care mail ID.

People who travel long distance for their work , this earphone is the right choice - You do not  have to pick your phone every time to receive a call , as the earphone comes with a Vibration mode its easy for you to pick a call .2. Equalizer is Well Balanced for this price Range and as i mentioned it does not support Deep Base , you can Tweak that with the any third party music player and increase the Base .3. people who go to Gym regularly for Cardio and intense workout , this will help a lot as it doesn't slip from your ear easily ( i do Tyre Flip in my gym )  , it is absolutely Sweat proof and no issue with disconnection .All i can say is simply go for it .

I bought this product mainly because of the 2 reasons.  Boult was suggested by my cousin, who used a wired earphone from Boult. She suggested this is one of the best budget earphones ever. 2. The battery life and dual connectivity. Handling laptops and mobile at the same time for 8 long office hour is kinda hard.First look of the productLooks good. Solid.After charging to a full 💯, i warmed it up a bit. Usually, for my beyerdynamic I had buned it for a 6 straight hours for the first time. I did a 3 for this one. Still the sound is pretty bad. I was mising anlot of notes.Mike - the worst Mike ever. A gentle breeze and it feels like a hurricane insideSound - worst. If you are into a variety of genres like Rock, classic, and alternate rock, you will miss a lot of music in this earphone.Overall. This product sucks. Don't buy2 stars are for the battery btw. It stays quite long.

I have been using it for couple of months and I have to say that I am thoroughly displeased and dissatisfied. I bought the product after reading the comments but after 3 months of using it, I realised that there were many problems -1. Low battery life.I listen to music while working and travelling but this earphone barely lasts 3 hours or so before giving out2. Bad connectionI always had trouble with it. The other person could hear more outside voice than mine and we could barely communicate; terrible noise cancellation.3. Bluetooth rangeSimply bad4. It stopped working!

Sound Quality is good and i am not sure about noice cancellation because have not tried these earphone in traffic or in such areas.I was bit concerned about buying this product as i had many choices in bluetooth 5.0 at the same price range, and here many people were saying its bluetooth 4.2.There is nothing to verify if its 4.2 or 5.0 but definitely connectivity is good. I do not face any problem while walking outside the room without mobile. As many people were complaining about connectivity issue.In 2 days i have not faced such issues, in my case range is about 10 to 15 feet without problem and upto 30 feet there will be slight glicth and that you can easly ignore.I have seen video on youtube and prime videos as well but i didn't notice any delay.Battery will last long enough about 2 days with whole day use.I was really worried about buying this product by seeing reviews but till now its working good.I will update my review after 15 days of use. If anything bad occur i will update

Good and comfortable . Ear clips added advantage for snug fit but if not needed ear clips can be removed as well.

After sales service of product is really dismal. I send the product back to them as it got out of order. What they sent me back, Fristly, Vibration function while on or off was not working. Secondly the connection between the device and the instrument has become poor & voice is not smoothly coming. Thirdly battery % indication is also giving false %. So what I mean to say is that company after sale service is really very very poor.

I had earlier ordered a BT headphone but I was not happy with the mic as its placement in earcups was reducing my audio volume at the other end. I had to return it. Then I ordered this one and this does the job beautifully. Audio and mic performance is very good. No static disturbance which I was hearing in headphone. Easy pairing. Moreover, no issues in using it for ultra long calls. You can wear it for day long without any irritation. After sometime, you even forget that you are wearing it in your neck. Looks cool too.I don't listen to music much so can't comment on that experience.Jun 15:The Power On/Off button is troubling now. It takes time to turn on the device as the button is no longer working properly. Reducing 2 stars now.Jun 22: Power button not working. No support from Boult. Buy only if you want to gamble.Jul 22: After complaint on website, I got it repaired and delivered back. Using it since last 3 days. Working fine so far.

Let me start by saying that it is an amazing product. Some of the people may have different opinion but my experience has been great. I believe it is one of the best product in market as of now.It has an Awesome sound quality for music, video & online streaming. I have played 8D sound music as well and the sound didn't break, the bass was perfect, could hear every beat perfectly. Battery backup is pretty good as it lasts for many hours on a continuous play. It is user friendly, perfect for daily use and the design is also good. The ear buds are moisture resistance i.e., it doesn't make your ears sweaty. The wire holder on both sides helps to keep the wire intact and it doesn't hang which prevents it from getting mixed up with shirt or the jacket.Overall, it is an amazing product and I would recommend to go for it.

I have a OnePlus 7...the bluetooth won't connect thru con calls. If I patch someone else in...the call kept going to the phone. This problem was never there with any other bluetooth headphones...sony, boat etc. none had a bluetooth problem.Secondly, the volume panel was loose. It felt very cheap the way it was attached to the stem.Bad experience - Boult.Plus, I feel the name is also a rip off to Boat...should've been my first clue of not buying. During lockdown, refunds are not given...but luckily the seller ran out of them so I got a refund and not a replacement.

I was purchased this earphone in Oct 2021 and it's stopped working (not powering ON) within 3 months (Jan 2022) .I have send mail to complain email ID and got reply after 2 reminder mail.They just send URL for raise complain on portal. Now after complain raised we need to deliver this faulty earphone to Delhi service centre and that delivery Charge paid by myself.I got same product after repaired within week. I just thank to that team for fast service.after earphone repaired within month same issue occurred.I have send almost 10+ mails on complain ID but no reply.Very bad service by boult.

I have used other neckbands in this price range, which have similar sound quality but what I like in this is the design, which looks modern and not too awkward.What I don't like in this is three things:Bluetooth connection stability - you loose sound if you move suddenly sometimes or if you go a bit away from phoneVery annoying vibration feature - the neckband rattles whenever a call comes, making you regret buying this, they shouldn't have bothered with that vibration feature, it's ridiculous, the build quality of the switches is not that good, feels very cheap, looks okay but feels cheap.Power saving feature - there are other neckbands which you connect and leave, if the connection is lost and later you come close to the neckband it will get connected again immediately, but this one gets switched off automatically if the connection is off, and the connection can go off very easily in this, so you have to keep switching on and connecting this back. Zoook neckband you can connect and leave phone charging or something and walk around freely without any problem, with this one you connect and stay within 2-3 mts from the phone.Overall I'd say if you want best connectivity buy zoook, if you want looks buy this.

Sound quality -  Decent sound with ok bass. 4/5Build quality - 4/5- Band seems to be sturdy however ear plugs are sensitive it may come out if fallen.Durability - 4/5- Within a week some static sound started coming when music is off. I replaced it from Amazon as it was under 15 days replacement guarantee. However it stopped getting connected to my phone post 1 month. As per the warranty process I had to courier to Delhi from Mumbai which cost me Rs200. After 8 days I have received the replacement order however it turned out to be defective product. Earlier it was not connecting to phone now they disabled the Vibration . I am unable to identify if any incoming call is coming or not.  When I told them they said as per the new update vibration has been removed to increase durability.Update : Just before its warranty was going to end, it showed charging issue. Since there was lockdown, I was unable to courier them. I wrote them an email stating the same & they informed to send the device after lockdown, though only 3 days were remaining it to end.After 2 months it's warranty ended I sent them my earphone 🎧 and within a week I got the replacement.

I ordered this as my second wireless headphone as the other one, boat was used only for movies/music.The product worked fine for a while but over a few days, it started discharging quite easily without much use. I tried charging that FULL for few times but the quest never ended.One fine day it refused to start up even after trying alot and multiple charging. Tried reaching out to the Amazon helpdesk and was told to contact the Boult, then tried and they responded with a plain email to send the product across (*This was during the lockdown period)I tried reaching them on their phone just to make sure an initial troubleshoot steps are done, but to my surprise, the phone went unanswered.The headphone are still lying with me and I am unable to use them. I am repenting on my decision to chose this brand.

I brought this on April2019,  i use this daily more than 5 hours since i brought this.i brought this speaker after using speakers from JABRA and skullcandy, all these brands fails after 1 year of extensive use...  So i thought to go for a cheap brandMajor Pros1) Cheap when compared to JABRA and skullcandy2) Nice fitting in ear (Good for sports)3) Sound quality is good enough for a amateur4) Works well with two devices simultaneouslyIssues1) Range or conectivity is the major issue,If you are using this with in your room, it work well, but you go to your next room, it will start breaking the voiceSeriously , i think this device works only in a range of 5 m only!2) Your headset will start vibrating soon once you get disconnected to your device, like a pulse( That means, you go to your next room for a cup of coffee, and your device will start vibrating (annoying) because of its low range coverage)3) The charging cable providing with the device was faulty and substandard, stopped charging from my second day. (i was worried initially and thought the device is faulty)ConclusionIf you are looking to save some money, go for this,And if you have any issues with range coverage, it's a buy suggestion

 I am writing after One year of use of this product. Material Quality of this product is really bad.Now outer layer of wire is tearing ,and inner wire is coming out.And in the starting itself if we shake the power button we can hear the sound as like it's loose in its position.In my case this product can last with in one year.

The sound quality is very good. Overall I am happy with the produdt. I use 3 headsets for multiple uses and found this one comfortable to wear and use (have used it for 3 hours straight) I use it primarily for my daily walk. I am not breaking it up into pros and cons but some unusual characteristics I noticed in this product but not noticed in othersSome unusualities I did notice1. Full volume is impossible ... It too loud2. Bass is good ... I would go on to say it's better than Boat rockers which also I use. Thats my personal observation ... Everyones liking is different3. Once put in the ear  outside noise is much lessened ... So a word of caution those planning to use it for cycling and biking .. you can get caught unaware of less sounds behind you4. After one hour of listening the charge drops to 80% which means about 4-5 hours of usage. The reason I brought this up is my realme buds after 1 hour shows as 90%5. Most of the head sets have the control on the right this one has it on the left, but big buttons are good6. last but the most unusual thing is I feel the left earphone has a slightly higher volume than the right. I asked another person to check my headphone and he too confirmed that it's a bit louder ... Have not seen any comment like this might be related to only my headset

I have been using this Product for almost 8 Months & I really love the sound quality of my Boult Audio Curve Neckband. Sound Quality is very decent with fine Bass Quality (Exactly same I always looked for). Battery backup is superb with one charge it can go on with all day. All over I love this Product and I would love to buy another products of Boult Audio in future.

I wanted to use this product for wireless calling but when i use it for calling i most of the times does not hear other persons voice and when i switch to phone speaker mode i hear a very clear voice. So if you are looking this product for wireless calling then please don't buy it. Its waste of spending money.And this does not have good range as well. Not even 2 to 3 meters. After crossing 1 or 2 meters you will hear lot of disturbances.Waste of money. Don't buy this product.With the replacement in place still the calling issue is present. The other person cannot hear my voice and lot of disturbances in between.

Ordered on 4th and received on 6th (today). I've been testing it for a few hours now, seems like I have received a defective one. Planning to replace it. Have to wait for another pair which I ordered to arrive, which is scheduled for 7th. I will have to compare both and come to conclusions.The problems i think i might be facing are :-1. More volume on the left buds than right.2. Poor bass at times.3. Serious interference issuse with the earphones while placing in the jeans pocket both front and back.Will update the review after comparing and opting for the replacement.Update : Got the replacement on 12/05/2019 Now the Bluetooth interference issuse is minimal, like the normal lag is only present. But the audio recording in whatsapp through the mic on the headset turns out to be low in sound. But during calls there's not any issues. I'm on journey now, I'll check it again throughout the trip and see whether it needs to be replaced again. Like they say, third times a charm.

Been using this almost everyday for the past 2 months. The major deal-breaker is that the battery backup went from 8-10 hrs to 5-6 hrs in 2 months.Also once battery reaches 20% , its as good as dead coz it will work not more than 10 mins..20% switching off is 10 mins or less.The mic is not good at picking up your voice since everytime i speak, the person on the other side complaints of low noise and i have to hold the mic close to my mouth which beats the purpose of being handsfree.Audio quality is decent at this price point.The buttons are not underneath a rubberized coating like boat..and it is hard to differentiate between the 3 buttons provide.It is not reversible, left earpiece cant be used in right ear due to its weird shape. I prefer a reversible earphone but some people  dont.Charging takes 2 to 2.5 hrs to complete. Not 1.5 hrs as claimed. Again this is too much time considering that there are other earphones with fast charging capabilities.Update:After contacting customer service for warranty, they asked me to ship the item to their address and bear one sided shipping cost. I'd rather buy another pair from a different brand than wasting time and more money behind this junk

90% of the electronic items used in the world are made in India like iPhone, iMac, HP etc. This wireless earphone is one of them. However, this has poor quality in specially noise cancellation.... And material look very cheap. This is made in local China unlike branded items mentioned above. They simply mentioned it's price as RS.4499 and give FAKE discount in Indian market. Amazon should think about it. The price should be less than RS 500. it,s not at all worthy. I suggest to go for branded one. I don't want to return as it will be a big hassale for me to wait for pickup boy again.

ive ordered boult curve earphones on a lightning deal which costed 899 /-There's only negative things to capture about this bluetooth earphones.* First of all the design of buds it doesn't stay fit in your ears even for a short amount of time it keeps falling and you have to keep screwing it in your ears again and again.* Still it was fine but then within a week it stopped working. Bravo!!!* Battery life : For first 3 days it was giving me a standby time of 1.5 days and back to back usage for almost 5 hours on a travel but for next standby time reduced to less than one day and usage time for 2-3 hours !!I suggest you go for some better brand this do really suck !! I returned this item and got my refund !! So if you wanna try you can absolutely !!

Sound quality is not good and is too harsh to listen continuosly. There is no noise cancellation and people around you will also listen what you are listening. I have a Samsung headphone (price 400) which is far better than this.PLEASE DON'T BUY AS THIS ITEM IS NOT RETURNABLE AS WELL.

I liked the look and reviews and bought it. used for 2 weeks. below are my findings.1. Bluetooth connectivity is terrible (When you walk or jog, you will loose the connectivity for call/music! lot of interruptions, i felt wired was far better)2. Feels like u are using a local china device when you hear the inbuilt voice response and feel the terrible and horrifying vibration (It vibrates like nokia 1100 old mobile)3. Battery is very good! but whats the use if you dont have better connectivity4. You loose the connectivity even below 5 meters5. Sound quality is very bad, its not pro-bass its low bass :P , high treble and very low bass, my google home mini's sound quality is better than this earbud.Best part, you cannot return item and get a refund ! you can only return the item and  replace with the same item. Its the First time I hated amazon for that.But I'm sure that its a quality damage and not a manufacturing damage!So, if you want a cheap wireless headset and can compromise on Sound quality and Connectivity Go for it.. Its really cheap.Or if you really care about connectivity and sound quality, never buy this. Its my personal opinion!Its the first time I am writing a lengthy review because, I regret buying this. :(and from now on I will never trust 'Amazon Choice' Tags :)

Everything is good for this neckband and I really liked it over Boat and pTron.1. Sound quality - Loudness is best in Boat, followed by Boult CurvePro and last is pTron. But sound quality if you want all tones, best is CurvePro no doubt!!2. Range - Its best in pTron, followed by CurvePro and last is Boat Rockerz 255 Pro3. Connectivity - I felt Boat is best on usability as once the power is on it automatically connects, same with pTron. But for CurvePro you have to press the power button for some time till you hear ready to pair or connecting, this to me sometimes bit confusing. pTron also doesn't have that problem but  pTron doesn't have ""dual pairing"", which other two supports perfectly.4. Consistency - I didn't get any drop or connection issues with pTron & CurvePro. But Boat was pathetic to me with frequent loss for fraction of seconds during skype meetings from Laptop, or jogging.5. Build quality - All are plastics but Boat is best, followed by pTron and last CurvePro.6. Comfort - I felt boat earplugs are heavy and can't wear for long time, for me this is worst and deal breaker. Moreover Boat doesn't have proper fitting neckband, very loose and wires are hanging in the front without control so very bad experience. If you are running or gymming this should be your last option. pTron is better than Boat but still have this issue to some extent. For this, CurvePro is ""unbeatable"" and I really liked their low weight, light ear plugs (though size could have been a little small).7. Battery - Boat is worst, really mean it! hardly 4-5 hrs so irritating to charge frequently as you have to open charging plug, connect the short charging wire in the middle of a call. Another deal-breaker for me. Both pTron & CurvePro are really great >12 hrs. CurvePro has faster charging too, so thumbs up for that!!8. Call Quality - Boat is again a deal-breaker for me. If you want to use for casual calling please forget it. My old mono and cheap bluetooth have better quality than this. Not a single call I had without getting a request to repeat or louder tone from other end. pTron call quality is also good, but best among these three are CurvePro. Though not tested in crowded and noisy areas with either of them.Overall - To me except build quality, Boat is the distant loser, and not sure why such hype for this!! I can live with pTron Tangent Plus also considering its price point, but if the budget is around INR 1200, I will recommend Boult CurvePro, no doubt - better and compact fit, controllable wire length, dual pairing, batter battery charging.Note: I don't know about the ""durability"" or ""Service"" as it's hardly a week of experience!!

I made a wrong decision to buy Boult curve. The device started showing issues from the 2nd day itself as it was not that easy to start it, I had find a proper spot to long press the button to start the device.After a month of use it started to show another problem of sound distortion and later it would not respond.People on the other side of the call were not able to hear me properly if I was using the Boult Curve during the calls.Finally this device is dead after use of 4 months.So, I don't recommend this device and instead I suggest to go for any other bluetooth neck bands.But, I must say that I was very impressed by the looks and design of this device.

I don't know whether the product is bad or I got a defective piece. Battery lasts only for one and half hour. Also if you connect this earphone to laptop, you can hear buzzing sounds.

I’m reviewing this after 1 yr and 7 months of using it everyday. The right earphone has stopped working but that’s after a good amount of yanking and pulling by my little one. No problem with anything else, including battery charge retention. It amazes me how a product at the Rs. 1k price point can perform so well for an extended period. I’m looking for a replacement headset and thought of buying something at much higher price levels including on amazon.com in the $30-40 range and have returned 4 headsets so far including Mpow, Anker, Skullcandy etc. This Boult outperforms the simplicity of function and build! The voice based “Power On”... “Connected”.. “Power off” messages are far better than any weird and confusing jingle that other headsets have for these actions... Also, compared to the others,  this headset I found offers fastest and most consistent pairing. On some  headsets, the main button for “Play/Pause” didn’t work on YouTube but did with someMusic apps. However, the Boult alone worked seamlessly across anything that could be played/paused. The sound quality, and noise cancellation might not be the best but I’m sure it is extremely supreme for this price point. And I’ve mostly used them for phone conversations and listening to lectures, so can’t talk much about music technicalities. I’m buying my second one now, still surprised with my inability to find anything I’d like even at higher prices..

Excellent quality. Great sound. Soft on ears. Have bought 4-5 bluetooth devices till now. This is the best. Have purchased extra set.Purchased extra set is a disaster. This model is without vibration. This one is quite bad.-Sound is not loud enough.-It gets disconnected from phone even though phone is showing that it is connected and battery is full. Switch off and switch on again to connect and listen to the ongoing call.-Sent it back as it was in warranty. Replacement came that has same problem.It is not the phone that has the problem, because their own old model is still working flawlessly with same phone

This is the worst Product you can ever buy.1. Bluetooth Range is less than half a meter. You can't keep mobile to trouser pocket because it wont work. Either you hols the phone in hand or keep it in shirt's Pocket.2. Left earpiece sound decreased by 90% in one and half days. Its hardly audible. Its working with one ear piece in 1.5 days.3. I got it replaced thinking may be my device has issue but replacement has same quality.4. You can only use if mobile is in shirt's pocket or you hold mobile in hold all the time. Direct line of sight is needed. I am confused if its Bluetooth or Infrared device.5. Please don't waste your money6. Amazon please refund me my money, I don't need this cheap product. I can get dame quality at railway station in 100-120 rupees.

Connects well and easy to use. but range is a problem, if any wall is present, connectivity is lost (hear strange sounds during that time). very poor range. I have sony ear buds, they are much better when it comes to range. Even inside the house if you move from one room to another (leaving the laptop/phone in the room), connectivity is lost.When using these earphone with Moto g8 plus phone i found issues. My phone was connected to wifi, when i use these ear phones the wifi get disconnected. Repeatedly saw this issue. However with laptop i didn't see this issue

This is a very very bitter experience with this headphone.Just 6days of using all the leveling gone,its completely washed up,never expect such scenario with this costly and branded product.It's sound output is like music playing in a Tin Can.Bass gone in just 6days of usage.The earphone's magnet gone,it's no more stick 2 speaker altogether.While charging Battery percentage never beyond 90%,I don't know why!!Battery last for just 3hours where company says 8hours of battery backup.It's a REFURBISHED PRODUCT for sure.Amazon should give importance to its brand name,and stop doing this type of fraud activity.I am going to return it.

Writing this review for Boult Audio ProBass CurveProPurchase date: 18/10/2020Delivery date: 22/10/2020Features that I like1. Vibration alerts for calls. (Very helpful)2. Bluetooth 5.03. Decent battery life for 2 days use.4. Good range (Bluetooth 5.0 feature)5. Decent sound quality. (For calling)6. Can work with 2 devices connected without any issues.Only thing I can complain about is sound quality while listening to Music. but then its priced at Rs. 1000. To overcome this problem I have downloaded 3rd party equalizer on my android phone.I initially faced issues with Mic but it was phone(Redmi Note 9) software issue. After updating phone software the issue was gone.Ear buds are comfortable and dont fall off the ears because of the additional grip.Magnets on the eardbus are just for keeping the keeping the earbuds together and they do not pause the music.The design of neckband is excellent as it is very lightweight and you can shorten the lenght of wire and they will not hang.If Boult provides an App for managing the sound & connections then it would be a great great deal.

Below is my Post 1 month Feedback for Boult Earphones1. Sound Quality (Voice-Bass-Noise Cancellation) - I like decent music, and this worked very well. I give 5 stars for it. Its bass is normal. And in most earphones that I have bought, they are mainly of 2 types, high bass and decent bass. So this one is decent bass. I like my music this way. Noise cancellation is very good.2. Build Quality - 1 month is not enough to speak on that. But it fits very well. There is an adjustment scroll, so we can adjust the length of the earphone wire. It seems durable. The ear buds fit well in the ear and even while walking, it feels very comfortable. I have not felt like removing it even once, while my daily walks.3. Battery - I have charged it for 3 hours in its first attempt. Now I only use it for 1 hour walk, and it goes on nicely for a few hours before depleting totally. Battery works good.

Pros:1. Good design. Wire is folded backwards - preventing wire shorting problem due to bends.2. Wire length adjuster provided3. Most important - longest stable bluetooth range which didn't break with 2 concrete wall in between. I have tried portronics and boat and their BT starts breaking at mere 2 meters; and gets worse with use for some reason.4. Charging port location is well placed - makes easy to insert the charging pinCons:1. No bass. If you are a bass lover, you will not like it.2. Buttons are not tactile. When you move your fingers on buttons, you can't be sure if you found the right button3. Finish is not as stylish and good as portronics or boat. It feels plasticky and the buttons shake in their sockets. While portronics or boat have smooth rubberized finish with raise tactile buttons.Conclusion:If you want BASS or overall superior audio quality - go for Portronics Harmonics 208If you want a long lasting product with reliable BT range and if you are okay with a little compromise in BASS and sound quality, you can go for BOULTBoat has less BASS and sound quality compared to Portronics, but is better than BOULT. The only plus I found with Boat is its good quality design and buttons. Sound quality is average.I finally settled for BOULT because it was the only product properly working (BT range & battery life) after 15 days of use. I really liked Portronics, but what's the use of good audio if the product is just going to last for a month. So I choose a better lasting one with a little compromise on audio quality.

There are several issues with this product line up. I got my unit replaced to make sure that it's not only the unit I have has the issues. But seems like this product has the issue.1. Bass is overwhelming, while the youngsters may enjoy listening the loud music, but I can't appreciate it for calls. Call Voice is not very clear.2. This disconnects multiple times.3. The receiver of the call gets some sort of disturbing sound4. Passive noise cancellation is not quite effective.5. There is some issue with vibration motor or software. It sometimes keep vibrating for long and need to be restarted.But there's not everything wrong. Few thing I like are:1. The battery backup, I use it for taking calls, and being a manager, I take call with my team and stakeholders almost entire day. And easily lasts 2 days.2. Connets with 2 devices at once, this is such an amazing feature. I can connect to my laptop and phone bith at the same time. I really like this.

I have been using this for the past 10 months now every single day and i loved the product. I have used Boat rockers and Mivi but i found this to be the most neutral sounding (Without thumping excess Bass), a great battery life and a good microphone for my office meeting calls via Skype .However the right side failed 2 days ago, Looks like the wire inside is broken. Now i have to send the product all the way to Delhi from Mumbai for the In warranty check. This is a big hassle where as Boat sends a person to your place for the replacement.Boult makes a good product but cheap out on quality of wire. Now the whole device is trash, lucky mine is in warranty.This was a problem with 2 boat headphones also that have had one side failed exactly after a year or so. Why cant they put the money where it matters and make the wires stronger? Planned obsolescence? Well i am not going to buy from such companies again. Will go for a brand like Sennheiser or Beyerdynamic and that too, only if they have atleast 2 years warranty. Cant trust any of these companies.

The Boult Curve bluetooth earphone is a good product at the price range of ₹999 during lightning sale. But the built quality of the product is not up to the mark as hyped by many buyers. The volume control buttons are a bit shaky and it feels as if the would come off after a certain time. The worst part of the device is its connectivity. I had my phone in my hand and yet the bluetooth device was having music lag. I even tried it on two other phones but the problem continued. Moreover, the range of the device is also very weak. It started to disconnect just going beyond a distance of 4 feet, with no door or wall as a distraction. Also, when I mistakenly placed my phone under my thigh, the device got completely disconnected. I've registered a return of this product. Will post a review again for the return policy.Hope this helps many new buyers before they carrierd away by the five star rating given by some buyers.

I bought this product thinking wireless would make my everyday much easier, little did I know that I'll have to spend half of my time in connecting and charging this. It shows so many hours of battery life but who will give a damn to such battery life if it will not even get connected. Everytime it gets disconnected. Charging shows full but still gets disconnected on its own. Moreover Amazon customer service is not even responding for any kind of help. The brand can't even provide with good connectivity which is such a basic for such device even after paying so much. Big no!

Do not buy this product or any product from the manufacturer. They have pathetic after sales service. My headphones stopped working within 2 months of purchase and there's no support from the manufacturer. It's better not to concern yourself. Also the product does not match any of the advertised features, be it battery life or range. Also the button configuration is a hit or miss.Do not buy this product unless you want to give it as a form of gift to someone you secretly hate.

This neckband clicks all good if not excellent or Outstanding.Sound is okay for its price of under 1k.  It supports basic SBC only. so Audiophiles wont be happy.(PubG Gamers and Audiophiles stay away and look for Oppo Enco M31 thats a beast but with less battery backup 7 hrs with a bonus of HiRes LDAC music and 30m fast charge.)Battery backup is nice gives almost 10 hrs to me.  Charging take 90 mins minimum.Mic is superb for indoor call taking and there is no lag in mic for calls and no one compaint to me.Its earpiece is so comfortable that I always use to sleep full night with it on and music playing.After 9 months of usage now its one side is not working and after 2 months I have been able to contact support at complaints@boultaudio.com  and they responded with a link to register a Ticket next to this they will advice. But yes they would want you to send in the neckband to their Delhi Production/Service office and they will repair it and send to you.So Customer care and post sales portion needs to be improved.

Ear buds silicon caps are good quality. They feel good in ear.Sound is also good for routine use. Does not hurt ears and neckband is comfortable to wear.The adjustment of the wires on the neckband is really helpful.Bass is okay.I felt right ear sound is low compared to Left on the 1st few day but still trying to make an opinion if these needs to be informed to company or not.Taking calls has been easy and mic is good as the voice is clear for other side. Still to try in traffic zones.Battery life has really good.Overall a very decent bluetooth wireless earphone at the price point.Cons:Storing it when not using is a challenge. Would have been great if a cloth pouch was given to store it when not using.

For those who are reading reviews and watching youtube videos comparing this Bluetooth earphone with others, here are my observations and experimental suggestions:1. First thing first, once you receive this set, connect it to your saved mp3 songs (no streaming), bit rate 192 kbps or more preferably 320.2. Then change the earbuds that came with the set to one size bigger, use Sony or Sennheiser or Boat buds if you have any of those.3. Connect and listen to same songs again. I am confident you will experience the difference for the better.4. Now a bit of technical observation: the response range of this product is actually 22 Hz to 14 kHz. What it means is that- it has brilliant bass response, better than even Sony or Boat, but poor treble response.5. Because of the balance tilted towards the low frequencies the sound is warm, clarity is average and treble is muffled.You will like its signature if you like to songs like say Ghungroo or Bang Bang or Kala Chasma, but not Saki Saki (both bass and treble heavy). Also old world songs will not sound very clear unless remastered.Bluetooth 5.0 works well, enabling it to stay connected with phone all the time and have a better battery life. Vibration feature has been omitted though.Quality of materials is acceptable and the way wires can be extended/shortened is brilliant. All in all at this price it's a steal.

Anyone who wants to use this headphone outside the house or use it while moving DO NOT PURCHASE THIS HEADPHONE. It has major connectivity issue while moving. Sound quality is amazing and everything else is just great for the price tag but a wireless headset should work while the phone is in your pocket, at least that is the ideal expectation. You cannot hear a song seamlessly even for 10 seconds while you are on the move.Please dont buy this if u wish to use this unless u r never going to use it outside your chair.

This headphone is quite decent if you are ordering it for taking official calls or talking on the phone itself. The audio from the earbuds is quite crisp and clear even at the higher levels. I was expecting some bass also from the product but it is not there still you can enjoy songs if you are not that inclined to bassy sounds (trying some equalizer settings might do some help, but on my moto g9 power even the equaliser settings dint change the sound much).Coming to portability it is delightful, owing to its less weight and ergonomic earbuds. The rubber placeholders provided with the earplugs ensure that the plugs stay in the ear holes without even getting too close to the eardrums. The wire although slim (less durable in comparison to the Boat ones) does a good job and the clips provided along with the headphone manage the length of the cords which I think is the best feature in this product.The battery life is acceptable, it gets charged in around 1-1.2 hours and stays with you for around the whole official day.Overall it is a great buy if you need headphones for taking calls and are not searching for a musical device. Amazon remains the best in delivery and packaging.

The sound quality is loud but not so crisp. The DEEP BASS is quite minimal. I could barely feel the bass, and pitch is so high that it blasts the ears. I've been a returning user of Boult Audio for more than 2 years. The wired earphones give the most perfect sound and this bluetooth headset is nowhere near it. If you're a music enthusiast then this one isn't for you, this one is for someone who doesn't care about the bass beats, needs only louder voice.

.Pretty comfortable and doesn't cause external ear trouble or pain..Fully charges in 1hr or under 1hr.Battery life is Normal. Stays charged for 5-6 hrs.Is flexible and wont damage if u bend it a bit.Sound quality is good the lyrics, melody, small sounds everything is heard..Cancels noise pretty well.Bass quality is good..Has good volume.The sound staggers a bit(on rare and small intervals) after sometime of use..Has really bad bluetooth connectivity. The connectivity doesn't last for even some meters if u take it away from the device it is connected to..Takes a while to get connected and paired to devices which gets irritatingConclusion: Pretty good product according to its price range. Find it better than the boats one cause got it in a cheaper price than boat ones and doesnt cause external ear pain whereas the boat ones does. Lasts well cause have now been using it for more than 7 months. Comes with an year warranty and u can directly give your feedback to Boult people cause they personally give u a call for a review after u buy their products. Just have the problem with the bluetooth range but the rest is nice.

I’ve been using this product for last One Month.I’ve previously used a Portronics Harmonics 222 which is a much better Product.My review:Pros:1. Bass is reasonably good.2. Look is reasonably good.3. Though the battery backup is Low, it gets charged quickly.Cons:1. Battery backup is very Low. If you use it for listening songs, it wouldn’t last beyond 1 hour.2. It gets disconnected and reconnects frequently even if the phones are kept as close as 3 to 4 meters.3. Many a times it gets disconnected during an ongoing call.4.  On switching On, it doesn’t get connected automatically always. At times you will realise it later and then will have to connect manually.5. There’s no Passcode required to Pair with any device, which makes the device vulnerable.6. Having already used Portronics Hanmonics 222 for a year, I now feel purchasing Boult Audio Pro Bass a mistake.Reviewed again on 20 Dec 2021:Don’t buy this Useless Product, which gets disconnected while you talk or watch Video.Third class item.

Product price jacked up to 3000 original price 1999This product lives up to it's claim of 12Hrs battery life. Takes 45 minutes in the morning to charge, average to moderate use gets the battery down to 40%Sound quality is really good/ great this is a very personal perspective.The built of the product is really neat and sits around your neck comfortably and the ear buds just sit in your ear without much effort. They could have improved the way the function buttons are by providing a toggle button to skip back and forward tracks or the volume control but this design is also very comfortable to use. I liked the product so much that I ordered 3 units and also recommended it to my friends. All feedback on use are good.Some feedback said that noise cancellation is kind of bad; but I have been attending calls on my iPhone everyday and the sound clarity and the voice of the other person is also clear. Have sent Voice notes on whats app. using this earphone, very clear but dictation isn't really that entertaining, perhaps an IOS issue.Overall a must buy if you like music and want to be able to be connected the whole dayUPDATE: Product purchased in Nov 2020; July 26, 2021 suddenly the speakers started to emit a loud static sound that wouldn't stop; tried to shut down the earphone by long pressing tghe Play/ Pause button but that did not help, tried to put the thing for charge, did not help. The static sound is still coming but it's not loud anymore but can be still heard. Might stop after battery dies; sound was deafening no longer connected to device via bluetooth

When I received BOULT AUDIO Curve Pro headphone for the first time (which took 3 days from the day I ordered) the original seal was already opened and they had used a regular gum tape to seal the box. Accessories like USB charging cable, extra ear buds and authenticity card were missing inside. I immediately asked for a replacement and very next morning I received a new box which was completely intact. Seal was not tampered and all the necessary accessories was there inside the box. So they tried to CHEAT me with the first order I received and that is the reason I am giving them 3 stars.Now coming to the product. Earphone is really good. Music sound quality is clear and bass is also upto the mark. Battery backup seems to be good till now. Bluetooth connectivity is good and gets connected to my phone immediately without any hassle. Call vibration alert is working absolutely fine. Even the voice clarity of the caller is also great. Even the other person did not have any problem in hearing my voice. There was no disturbance during the call. However, when I tried to walk away from my phone (distance approximately 15 feet) I had some difficulties in hearing the caller.Overall I would give 4 stars to this product.

Light music ..good for ones who prefer it.4. Noise cancellation is there as being a teacher I have not rcvd any complaints abt background noise frm me students.5. Light weight n sturdy.6. Very good for this price range.Cons:1. During meetings u can't hear background sound of videos or ringtone of ur call.(Bt that can be avoided).Let's see if I develop any other features ..will definitely let u knw..till then go for it.👍

I received a open box both the seals were broken.Anyways let me give you a review about this product-#It is comfortable to wear for a couple of hours as the size of earplugs is appropriate.#Build quality is average,parts inside it rattles as you shake the neckband, rigorous shaking of the neckband might break the internal connections.#range is good,upto 5-7 metres it works perfectly but above this range sound breaks too frequently.#battery lasts for 5-6 hours.#volume is less,you have to listen at atleast 50% of your phone's volume to listen to something clearly.

I had bought this earphone for my daily calls and meetings. Below are my findings:1> The noise cancellation is quite good.2> the voice quality is also great. i can hear people well and they can hear me well.3> The band is light weight and do not feel like a weight on my neck.4> Good to hear songs while running. The sweat do not affect the band.5> The talk time is superb and covers my office time. With one full charge it can go for 10-12 hours.All I can say is I am happy with the product and I recommend you to buy this product if need be without any doubt.

The ear plugs are an issue that needs to be addressed by all ear phone makers. Be it Sony, Jabra and every other; none comes close to Bose design. They are so thoughtful in designing the ear plugs that does not needs to be pushed in. It simply just clings to your ear without stretching it apart. I have used it for hours and feels so good.This ear piece like every other needs to be pushed in the ears which kind of strains it and causes headaches when used for even 15 mins. Bad design to say the least.

I am writing this review after one year of extensive usage. So I have tested these headphones thoroughly and used them for all kind of situations - only music, phone calls, Video Conferencing Calls while connected to laptop etc.The bass and sound quality while listening to music is just excellent. At about 80% volume, the sound is loud enough and all instruments can be heard clearly and separately, including bass guitar.During audio and video calls the sound quality is decent enough. And I have not received any complaints from parties on the other line that they are not able to hear me. So the microphone and noise cancellation also works great.The battery life is ok. And since it's now been one year, the battery life is dwindling a bit, but it still lasts long enough. I have also successfully paired it with two devices at the same time, and found no issues.Overall, a great purchase for a reasonable price.

I had to have a previous set replaced because the person on the other end complained of muffled voice. So, I suppose there was an issue with the mic. This pair seems to be better. Though, I still need to hold the mic part closer to my mouth at times and that defeats the purpose of a handsfree set.For music, they are decent. Not great. Though, I use them mainly for calls, as my earlier Boat earphones conked out quickly and I'm trying to preserve these. Lol. So, for other media, I use my chunky headphones.Not sure I would buy them again.

My previous Bluetooth earphones suddenly stopped working and i was seeing a lot of ads by boult and so i decided to give them a try. The first pair i bought sounded better however had a problem where the Bluetooth would stop for a second and resume on its own automatically and so i got a replacement today. The second pair while doesnt have any problems, they do sound quality performence is very very very poor and terrible. The audio quality is nowhere near the competition and they have no good qualitiy  bass at all. The audio is very high pitched for some reason. The only good thing about the earphones is the build. While the durability is a bit flimsy the design is good. Wouldnt recommend buying them though.

Hello buyers, i was a fan of this boult audio earphones after using them since many months, in july i ordered probass curve pro, and i am happy using it till, but today in august for my family i ordered another one same color same model, i just received it today and so i had to rewrite this review coz the new models of them featuring male voice in them speaking on, off and pairing, as the one i ordered earlier has a female voice in it, but this new ones are just ridiculous and cheap quality, sound quality is the worst ever, even a 299 rupee wired earphones will sound proper, but these are nothing more than a trash, please buy it with caution. Hope it becomes useful to you. Good day.

Looking for a good wireless earphone under 1500 bucks for a very long time. A few days came across this product, did some research and decided to buy it. My first impression, loved the product., very lightweight, seems very durable and got really good sound quality for this price from a Bluetooth earphone. Talking about battery life, Its been 14 days since I bought the product and I use it around 1 hour daily & today it the first day I charged it. So a very brilliant battery life. Kudos to engineers at Boult for making such a good product for a very low price.

Sound quality is normal, bass is not that much punchi don't expect better at this price point. Got in white coloured package though the previous one & as per the company site its black one, don't know this is original or a copy product. Very important part is no user manual available in box even details about the product is not mentioned anywhere on box as per the previous box & as the mentioned on Amazon about Bluetooth version, Qualcomm CSR chip for noise cancellation etc. nothing mentioned anywhere on box as well a leaflet provided inside the box. I got opened box as seal was broken so i doubt this is really original product or just copied one. Unfortunately returned this though got it in a deal @999 but i think quality & the product should be atleast the same as mentioned during purchase or as per the companies offering, whether the cost is for any product 500 or 5lacs.

Product arrived early.Though the sound is really good, loud and clear. The bass was not the way i expected but nonetheless it is impressiveFor my use, i like earphones which can produce clear and loud sound, since i don't listen to music muchThe battery backup is amazing on continuous playback of videos on YouTube it have be arlund 5-6 hours of battery and on standby i lasted for nore than a day approximately.Really lightweight and the way earphones have been attached the the controller is good, as the wire does bot gets damaged.The design of earphones is really good, it doesn't hurt if your wear for extended periods of time.Moreover the management of cable is also amazing.On top of.it 1 year warranty is amazing.Update: stopped working within 1 month, after the warranty ended. First the left side failed, and then within 3 days the other side as well.

1.Poor connectivity with OnePlus 62.Too much distortion3.If touch to button pad of headphones sound is breaking4.The Bluetooth signal range where headphones can connect properly is less than 2 feet.5.Connectivity is sometimes stable if the phone and headphones both are stable, a small movement of mobile or headphone distorting music or call.6.It's getting impossible to use in Gym.7.I verified my mobile phone with other 5 Bluetooth headphones, speakers sound and music is perfect hence its issue with Boult Audio ProBass Curve in-Ear Earphones.8.Worst part is they have very bad support.As per information on box I dropped multiple mails, and called multiple timesThey send auto reply that someone will contact you in 24 to 48 hours but there is no communication.9.Sound is not that great, but what if you face issue and you are not able to claim Warranty10.It's made in china too.11.Better to go with realme or boat headphone they are way better in sound and has good brand value hence support too.I am posting this review after 1 month of useProbably I will try to capture this issue add video later

Packing :The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.Box contents :Boult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).First impression :The earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.Buttons :The brick on the right side has the buttons.We get 1 multifunctional button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off.you can also attend the calls and end the calls by single pressing them.while playing music you can pause/play by single press.You can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.Connectivity :Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.Battery:The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.Additional features :These earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating. I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.Sound quality :Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.there are no concerns according to me till now .I'll update when something goes wrong.

First of all, I was confused about which brand to buy and what features to choose because they are simply too many options. I almost decided to buy WeCool or BoatRockerz. But then I decided to research outside Amazon and once again I found so many reviews. But to cut a long story short I found that Boult is a good brand and that its products are good value for money. But having said that I had very low expectations. So when I received the product early this week and opened the package, I got a feeling looking at the product packaging itself that I am not dealing with some fly-by-night operator. So I looked at the manual which came along with the pack and it was clear and easy to understand.So... switching on was quickPairing was hassle freeSound quality is very good. People on the other side hear our voices very clearly even if we whisper and we can hear their voices crystal clear.I still need to pair it with my laptop, which I will do later... maybe this weekend.But I am happy with the product so far

Product did not last even for a month. Bought it by looking at its low price. Sound quality and design is good but reliability is worst. On raising the complaint with the Boult company, mailed  me to ship the product at company address at own arrangement and cost. Worst of it I called them twice to their customer care, waited almost 20 minute everytime in queue but the customer service did not reply and phone got disconnected. Without raising my concern i lost  40 min on phone. I even mailed them my concern but they never replied.One must choose not only the low price product or offer but also check on the servicing quality of the company is providing.Boult is uttermost disappointed for me. Be sure to check the customer service support on the product one purchases.

At the time of order, I expected more bass and sound quality at this price.)3. Not value for money, means definitely overpriced.4. It has only replacement, no refund,  otherwise i will refund it.5.

Received the product with already seal intact and another sticker placed on top to hide that, possibly indicating a refurbished item.I was okay with that. It also had minor scratches.But the left ear piece had rattling noise and that's very much disturbing.Placed order for a replacement and now lets see, what I'll get.If I am happy, I may edit this review.Anyway with the first impression, bass is not punchy as advertised. I have another aptx headphone and you cant compare it with that.Battery backup seems decent, as I didn't charge it for 2 days, and total use time was around 8+ hrs.Dual pairing is good and fast.

Note - Some Harshita from Boult Audio called me and influenced me to write this review in return of a reward of 200 in my paytm wallet. I have given my genuine review but now they have not given any reward. So do not write any feedback if you are writing for the reward.The main reason I bought it was its design. Specifically, the adjustable length of wires. I wanted it mainly for calls and not for music. Calls quality is good. Mic is not catching distant sounds which is usually an issue with wireless headphones, but not with this.From audio perspective - bass is not that great as advertised. Just OK. Noise cancellation is also not very good. Not good for music listeners.From design perspective - its not true that you can wear it all day long. Actually you start feeling it on your neck in some time. Especially if both earbuds are connected through magnet and hanging on your neck. I wish I had bought curve pro which is way lighter than this.Packing and Delivery - Initially I got a damaged packing with used and dirty headset which I got replaced. The new packing that I got also had re-sealed box with tampered seal below it. I accepted anyway. User manual was missing from the box.The model I got has volume up button below and volume down button up (see image). This doesn't make any sense. Also, double clicking on power does not dial last called number. Double clicking was working in the model that I got in the damaged box which I got replaced.Overall I am satisfied because it does the job for me which is audio calling.

This is really cool bluetooth neckband within 1k price range. It looks stylish, comfortable, easy to use and move around, great fit for exercise or running, bluetooth range is awesome, lightweight, flexible, sound quality is vry good, call quality is good too. (not too much bass that's alright I'm not a bass lover but it's enough bass for music lovers and I'm not sure about gaming music or lags as I do not play games). Overall it's totally worth the money and definitely an AWSOME neckband. I'm happy and satisfied with the purchase.

It's been quite some time that I've been using this device. Was happy in the beginning. One side of the device stopped functioning after a couple of months though. Sent it for warranty coverage. Other manufacturers send you a replacement but to my surprise the same device was repaired and sent back. Would have had no complaints, had the device functioned normally. It worked nicely for a couple of days and then it went kaput again. One side of the earphones again went bad. Repeated failures actually makes you repent owning this device. worst of all, it randomly disconnects from the phones its connected and then reconnects.NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH THE WAY THIS DEVICE FUNCTIONED. I SO WISH THAT I'D BOUGHT A ONE PLUS RATHER.

ConsPurchased this product for calling my friend who is in overseas. But got disappointed as later observed that while making OTT calls get dropped after sometime citing some MIC related problem. Filed for replacement, however replaced product also has same issue and hence returned the product. Written to Boult customer care regarding this but they asked to send the product to some Delhi service centre address. No official or unofficial support for firmware upgrade. Seems like this issue affects other high end bluetooth headsets as well for android version of whatsapp. Base quality not good enough. Treble quality not good enough.ProsBuild quality is good and comfortable to use. Works well with VOLTE calls good microphone reception is truly an advantage over other headsets. Another advantage is the availability of Vibrate on incoming calls feature.

Purchased Oct 23 2020. Stopped working in March. I never had any issues but I didn't use it for a two weeks and it had discharged. So charged it again using a usb cable and usual phone charger, but it didn't charge. decided to connected to ps4 charging port oddly It started charging. Over the next ten days, it wouldn't hold the charge every time I charged it and didn't use it for 24 hours. This is weird behaviour, the discharge rate shouldn't be this fast. Finally it stopped charging at all, despite multiple methods. And I have requested a ticket under warranty and its been 5 days. I really like boult as a brand and I don't expect amazing customer service but atleast survive for a year without issues!? Let's see if this warrants an update at a later date.Update 23/3/21: My ticket hasn't been followed up yet.Update 09/04/21: My ticket hasn't been followed up yet. sent them another email.

Horrible experience. It never connected to my laptop or anyone's laptop. I have the earphone to my IT support guy to connect it to laptop ; surprisingly they showed me that all other Bluetooth earphones connected but not the Boult one. The customer care was so useless that I have up on my complain and  started using only written my iphone. Now few months later ; the right earphone stopped working. Its still in warranty but due to my previous experience I have limited hope that Boult will help.I think in transactions like these- Amazon should have certain criteria or servicing agreements with product company. I may have not bought this from Boult website but when Amazon sells the same thing; we tend to buy due to Amazon trust.

I think after 7 days of use I am able to review the Bolt Audio Probes curve.  This product I am using for home purpose work.  I enjoyed using this product.  The bass quality is good when you play the song.  The call quality is also good when you are at home or outdoors, I have used it even when riding a bike in the rain this time I was wearing a raincoat, its phone calling quality was excellent.Bluetooth connectivity is also good I have used from a distance of more than 7 meters, I want to give the battery backup 10 points out of 10, I get the battery for more than 4 days and the one who uses too much gets 2 days running time. Normal Noise cancellation is a little better. But this price range it is okay.Over all this product is great and value for money.

Hi all, Please don't purchase this product as I am telling very serious note to all if you buy then you can lose your money hundred percent, why this note I bring to all means, I purchased this product about three months and later the button which is not supporting switch on / off, later I raised a request and nobody willing to support me about the product warranty, I seriously disappointed this product.it is a waste of money paying about Rs 1000/- for this kind of headphones. customer care support and warranty should be provided as per the rule but it is not supporting to customer.

Update: It lasted me about a year. It's good if it lasts. I will change my recommendation to won't simply because after a year of use it's battery melted (thankfully didn't explode) while charging. So it's a fire hazard and to be charged with extreme caution.Been using it for about 2 months now, the battery life on this has been excellent. Been using it primarily to listen to music and audio books. Serving that purpose very well indeed. Consistently getting 11+ hrs of playback. Takes about an hr to fully charge. The sound quality may not be the best but for the price it's very good. It also works as a regular Bluetooth device to answer calls and have not received any complaint from the calling party about bad voice quality.

Hey,I ordered this earphone on sale and after 30 days I noticed the following disadvantages:1. There is some issue with the microphone feature2. For warranty replacement, you need to courier this to BOULT service center at your own cost. For BOAT earphone, the courier is paid by company but for BOULT, the courier charges have to be paid by customers.3. The wire quality is bit thin and low. I little stretch or pull may break it easily.
"

One of the earphones came apart by itself within 9 weeks of purchasing the item. While the first Amazon customer service agent I chatted with assured me that Amazon would replace the item, then second agent said that I'd have to contact the manufacturer regarding my problem, and that Amazon won't replace the item even though I bought it from them. Contacted the manufacturer, who asked me to courier the item to them in Delhi on my dime after which they'll decide what to do next. Dodgy quality and even dodgier customer service, especially from Amazon, which I wasn't expecting.

If you are looking for a earphone with better clarity sound rather than a one with high bass, this is the one for you.You can get a clear audio ouput in both call and songs/movies even at high volume, without any disturbance. Even though bass is not very high,i didn't feel much difference compared to Boat rockerz 255.There is a notification voice for power on/off, pairing & successful connection. The connectivity range is ~7 meters,after which audio starts to break.Though no earclip is present, the buds will fit comfortably in the ear. As the wire length adjustment is possible, looks cool without any wire dangling on the side.....with magnets provided in the buds. So buds can be locked when not fitted in ear.As for the battery backup, though I haven't fully depleted it, the charge dropped to 70% from 100% after 3-4 hours of continuous use (songs/movie). And took ~30 mins to fully charge from 40%.Waterproof tested with buds cleaned with water without submerging it... No problems found.Only minus I've noticed so far is the ringtone in the headset, which is mostly fixed for the headset..... is not very likable and could have been better. Don't know whether you can change it.So I'm fully satisfied with the product so far...after a month of usage.

Writing after months of usage...Sound quality is absolutely great. The bass and treble are good. Fits very nicely in the ear and neck band is also very light with soft outing, so you won't feel a thing on your neck. Boult is a very good company for audio based on my personal exp.The only point where it lacks a bit is the bluetooth range. Don't get me wrong. It's still very good when the phone is in your pocket and you won't face any issues. But the range of Boult Airbass and Boult probass Boost is amazing so just that.Overall an awesome budget product.
"
2161,"
It doesn't feel like the MRP price as it is shown.5K and the quality are way poor.As expected, when we stick together the earpiece the band should switch off, but it doesn't.So, you need to manually switch off the band to disconnect and to reconnect switch on again, and auto-connectivity doesn't work well as well.Since I needed dual connectivity so I won't return.But don't go for it.

I dnt understand y it doesn't hear to other when I speak no proper mic stability.sonetimes mic wrks and sometimes it does not. I see this product is stylish and.. We get a adjustable strap so it's pretty decent.Battery life is very good.I see a vibration feature when I receive a call Or text.. It's gud  but as a customer I may look for vibration once I receive msg for 5 sec max but this device keeps on vibrating for so long sometime even if yu open the msg. So this can be changed.Bass is pretty decent.Pain in the ears if continuously used for more than 4 hrs..  Boult team can work on this..But overall I see it as good products which can be customised a little more to give customers a good product.

This is an awesome bluetooth earphone wirh good connectivity and sound. Didn't face any issue during conversations. Music quality is average but it doesn't matter for me as I bought it only for speaking to the people on the go. I rode few kms keeping mobile phone in the pocket and it didn't disconnect. It works good with mobile and awesome with laptop. When connected to laptop, I can loitre in my house freely as the range is good. Only the glitch I found is that for me it connects to two mobile phones at a time but doesn't connect with laptop and a phone simultaneously. It could have done wonders for me if this was done. Not sure if this is the characteristic of this product or I got a defective piece. Otherwise, I'd recommend to go for it without a second thought. If you want call vibration option then curve pro shall be the first choice.

Submitting this review after 2 months of usage.This is my first Bluetooth headset. Before this I used many wired earphones of various quality below 1500/-. All of them, I like MI and Boat. Both have good fidelity. Comparing with them, Boult also good enough. The volume is good and sound quality is good. I am not a bas craving, so i can't say about that. Comfortable to wear. The built looks water resistant.  The backup also good.  I had used it about 12 hours of standby, with around 6 hours of usage. Till now never I had got low battery. Overall this a good quality product.

I used this product for a month before it started giving me problems. The bluetooth would ho off in between calls thereby causing problems with disconnection. When an issue was raised, the product was picked up for rectification. The same product was supposedly repaired and sent a week later. Thia time the same problem persisted in addition to the volumes buttons being dysfunctional. When a rocket was raised, I was asked to send the product myself as they had stopped pick ups. This raised a red flag immediately cos' the number of complaints must be quite high for the company to withdraw this service. I called the call centre to tell them that I would like a refund as I'm not keen on going back and forth with a defective product. They told me a refund is not possible but that they would replace the product with a new piece. I sent the defective product using a courier service and waited to receive a replacement. Unfortunately 2 weeks later I get the same defective piece with the same problem. This is not only a waste of money but of time, energy and resources for many many people. It's sad that I had to write  poor review but I'd like to warn other potential buyers of my plight before they purchase this product. Buy it and it will only be your burden to bear.

Edit: ONE SIDE STOPPED WORKING AFTER 3 MONTHS. CAN'T REACH THE SUPPORT TEAM. NO MAIL OR MESSAGE FROM THEIR SIDE. CAN'T EVEN REGISTER A COMPLAINT. WASTAGE OR MONEY.OLDER REVIEW: Writing after 1 months of usage. The band length is a bit small. There are 3 pairs of the earbud covers and a small charging wire provided. the feature of closing the wires on the band is an excellent feature! It is more comfortable to wear and even sleep wearing it than the Boat ones. The sound quality is good, but Boat is better in this department. Bass is good and pleasant. However, if you want a higher Bass experience, go for Boat. The mike and noise cancellation during calls is better than Boat. It has its own volume regulation independent of your phone/PC settings. So, when you are listening and can't hear, increase your earphone and then regulate your phone/PC volume. The connection to Bluetooth is very easy on phone and PC. The earphones come charged. So, can use directly. Overall, a decent product.

1. First impressions! Cheap packing, cheap box.. I can see where they tried to save most of the money, the logo on the earphone is not engraved and more or less is a sticker. Probably an outsourced work.2. Thinking of the price, I think it's an okay product and is a much better buy than any other product at this price range.3. Sound Quality is adequate, there are some hollow sounds at times.. bass sounds cheap, treble sounds cheap, overall audio is good but doesn't hits the spot where it can put you at peace. But thinking of the price point, it's amazing. Finally, and for those that hear at low volumes won't really enjoy it.. it's more focused on the people who enjoy listening at high volumes, so you can happily forget listening to jazz in it.4. My previous earphone were *nu Jaxx*, it had one of the best sound quality in the audio department but it's biggest losses were, it's mere 1Hr battery, and very low range, less than 1m. So had to buy, something better.5. Build Quality seems okay, the tactile button seems a bit fragile and sometime don't take input. There is no manual pairing button, therefore it will always broadcast itself , something to think about for privacy concerns.6. My only worry, is the overly fragile wire that goes in the earbuds, it's too thin, too small, and in no way seems that it can withstand much of torture, specially if you are one of those that travel in mumbai trains.7. Overall an okay product... I guess, if you can save a bit more money, I'd rather recommend you look for something else. If you just want a quality earphone, go for Boat. But of you want quality, idk... Save up more money I guess.8. Finally, good battery. Been using for 7 hours straight, at 70% volume. No issues.

I have already used a SkullCandy Ink'd Wireless for more than a year but when that one got damaged I decided to purchase another wireless headset keeping the following things in my mind:-> A headset with water resistance-> A headset with better sound quality-> A headset with decent battery backup-> A headset with vibration alert, because I don't like to keep my ears plugged in all the time.-> A headset with dual connectivity, so that I can connect my phone and laptop parallelly to it.-> A headset with a slim neckband.And all such requirements got fulfilled with this headset.If all of the above things are your requirement too, then go for this product blindly.Finally Thanks to Amazon.In and Boult for this amazing piece of engineering.

Its overall good package.  Audio is comparatively good. Mids are bit recessed and slight echo is added for real feel. Bass is good but not punchy, it is overshadowed sometimes by mids. Coming to built quality. Its good, worthy in 999/- price tag one will not feel it cheap. But flat wires might have an added advantage. Battery backup is excellent. It can withstand 4-5 days on idle and 2-3 days on average use of 4-5 Hrs daily. If you are an audiophile and looking for budget bluetooth earphone, its not meant for you. Final Verdict: Unless you are not an audiophile and wants a good bluetooth earphone this might be best option to choose from. Its a worth buy for daily use and have superb battery backup.

I had bought this in May 2021 and just in 1.5 months Curve Pro had problems buttons stopped working and it never turned off or on....So I sent it back for warranty claim.....  It's almost one month over the repaired/replaced items is not yet dispatched and even worst thing is that Boult Audio is not responding at all. Whom to complain. Even their complaint portal is also not replying....So I suggest everyone not to buy this, since if you face any problems and send it back, they will never send you back a replacement or repaired item.....SO DON'T BUY THIS.....

Though voice quality over phone call is okay, music quality is not up to the mark. Sound is flat and suitable only for voice calls. Again, sound will spread to nearby and disturb others if put on high volume. Plastic used is of low quality. Spent Rs.999 for this, but I feel I should've gone for JBL or something by spending another few hundreds. It looks like a very local product. After a month, the magnetic power (to keep the speakers connected together) of the speakers lost. Recently saw Boat for the same price, sound quality is amazing. I won't recommend this..waste of money.

Normally I don't comment on products purchased. But, this item made me comment here.Received this product on 22nd Sept. Really nice premium looks, good call quality, so strong battery, am being a music lover liked the music quality very much, crystal clear. Very deep bass lovers may go to the higher range.Don't consider the negative comments unless you receive the faulty product.Very nice and easy dual pairing. I needed a bluetooth device both for mobile and laptop calls and this serves the purpose much better than expected. You will never regret buying this amazing product in this price range. I recommend this to everyone who wish to buy wireless neckband.

Good product but Boult service needs to improve.The sound quality is good and call clarity is also good. The product was working fine for few days and later it stopped working after 1 month. I had to send it to the customer care to get it serviced. When they returned the product they returned it in some box of their own while I sent it in the original box. Also the accessories were not returned to me by the Boult company. I was not able to contact them again my calls were blocked by them and mails are not being delivered. Also when you buy the product Boult as you to put a good review in Amazon and send a screenshot if it through whatsapp and they will send you cashback personally. Such things should not be encouraged.

Review 1I bought this headset via Amazon in Oct.2020. I did notice that the box seal a bit tore, but went ahead and accepted the parcel. The setup and sound quality were good for the price. I was able to easily connect to my laptop and mobile, carry on attending office calls. Exactly one month and the ON/OFF switch malfunctioning.  Later the headset was not getting charged too. I had registered my product earlier with Boult Audio and they also kindly acknowledged the complaint. Now I am returning the product via courier to their New Delhi address. Boult audio has assured of proper action and replacement.  Will write another review soon after I get a response from Boult audio.  Happy with the fact that their support team acknowledged my complaint and are acting upon it.Review 2 will follow...Review 2 ..(11/27) Soon after receiving the product after repair... The ON/OFF switch is working... Thank you Support team.... Review 3 will follow after a week of my routine...Review 3...Reduced to one star :( Product is a failure...again the ON/OFF switch is not working...

So I've been using this product for a year now, and I think this is the best flex earphones out there. Not that I own many, but lots of my friends have Boat flex earphones, and they are cool too. But one thing this is definitely better in, is that they have adjusters for their wires, by which you can adjust the length of the wires hanging down your flex band. The audio quality is very good, and the flex quality is extremely good. It's so light you forget that you're wearing it. You can wear it and sleep, you can sleep on it by mistake. But it takes it all, it has such a good quality material. Totally functional, and has good audio quality too. Why wouldn't you buy it?

I purchased Boult Probass curve in October 2020. By the begining of December the product stopped working. I placed a complain and they told me to courier the product to them for repairment. I regularly purchase stuffs from different website but never came across such a pathetic service where I have to courier my faulty product (even when it is under warranty period). I recieved my product after 2 weeks in January 2021. Then again by the end of February it stopped working. Now when I contact the customer service. They keep my line on hold for half an hour after which I eventually have to cut the call. Please never buy Boult products. Your money is precious, so better go for brands like BOAT (their service is highly appreciable).

Coming straight to the point. This neckband does have VIBRATION ALERT. As many have pointed by just reading NDTV reviews and others, this earphone has a VIBRATION alert feature in its right side, which is moderately effective.The mic quality is decent but as its being used at home so no complaints about background noise.The bass is thumping. Its high, its big and its true to the wireless neckband name. But it comes at the cost of mids and highs. Clarity of sound especially lighter instruments gets muffled due extra bass. Though no issues, its value for money at Rs 1099.The buttons are tactile and pronounced.The plastic quality is average, though unit feels strong enough. The earpiece wires can be adjusted accordingly to requirement and the volume is very high.Overall a value for money product.

Good word to explain this headphone is crisp and bassy , but you need to tweak it by using equalizer to get bass out of it. Recommended equalizer are afx , bass booster and equalizer bass booster and volume booster.Built qualityI have used only four days, wires are very thin look like low quality , I give built quality thumbs down and leave it up to you to take this risk.ConnectivityThis is the worst Bluetooth connectivity I have ever seen. If you move your mobile little far away it disconnects. You have to keep your mobile very close to the headphones to use it , keep it in your pant pocket will work .Again thumbs down in this sector.HighsIt is very clear for me , don't expect too much depdth ,then you will get disappointed.In this sector it performs average.MidsMids very clear , average performer in this sector.LowsVery clear , average performer in this sector.Noise isolationIt works very good , you won't get disappointed.Above average in this sector.CallsNo problems ,very audible.Above average in this sector. BassFully satisfied, very deep bass, again as I said you need to tweak it using a equalizer. Excellent performance in this sector.ConclusionIf you like bassy sound then this is the headphone for you , sound clarity is only average don't expect too much depdth .Price is fixed very affordable and it is acceptable.Final verdict is very much recommended headphones to use.

Hi,I wish if I could give it a 0 star.Don't know, who is giving a 5-star rating. Fooling peoples. I never write so bad review of any product if it just OKNot Satisfied..I hardly used it 2-3 times and the battery is not charging. I charged it for 4-5 hours but battery is not charged. Tried another charger and cable still the same. Even though it shows red light for charging but it doesn't chargeand it's power button never work properly. Really disappointed. I don't know what to do and how to claim. I have called many times to customer care but they didn't pick my call.Worst connectivity issue.Even if you don't move, even if you are watching the movie on PC form mere 5-foot distance, still it stutters. Third class connectivity. When there is such problem, what is the use of all that Music quality and durability?Simple logic is, do not buy. Go for a branded product.

I got it for 999 Worth the price and built, it's not excellent for Running but good for indoor and mild to moderate workout, voice calling if flaw less, good connectivity with no disturbances, Don't know about water resistance but definitely sweat proof, Sound is very sensible at 75-80% volume (Mild distortion at higher volumes)and good battery life!Over all buy if less than 1300 maximum! Not with more than that!

It is a value for money product and works well. Call audio quality is also acceptable. Battery life is not tested until exertion, but it must be decent after 3 hours it was still 80%. Bass is only slightly less than my previous Sony blue tooth. But overall I will give five stars to this product on every aspect. The finish is ultimate, and earbud shape is highly accurate for Indian ears. They do not fall. The wire merges into the frame cavity is an excellent concept. Storage can be sufficient. It was delivered Well packed. I am satisfied with the product. Thanks.

Sound Quality is good.Design and Comfort is excellent, not heavy, fits in ear comfortably and not painful even for long hours.Battery life was surprisingly good. I actually use earphones for less than 60-90 minutes a day for calls and media but it is connected almost all the time, hence the standby time seems to be good.Still prefer the wired earphones for the quality of sound but yes finally the bluetooth earphones are getting better and proving value for the money.

This is the second headphone from Boult. The performance of the first one was very good however the wires got peeled off and therefore needed another one. Gone for the same model as they are kevlar braided wires. Last purchase was for ₹1199 this time I got it for ₹899. The mic is very powerful. Excellent for speaking to someone on phone. After using for a week I realised that bluetooth connectivity is poor. Even pairing takes time. Overall quality is inferior than the earlier one I was using.

Got it at deal price. Value for money purchase. Sound quality is good. Bass is adequate given the ear bud type. Only complain is the low battery warning.

Delivered on the Independence day.Pros:1. The neckband design is slick and perfect for commuting.2. Adds a lot more convenience due to the fact that earphone cords are inward and not jutting from the neckband endpoints, thereby offers a neat look without any wire entanglement.3. The navigation controls are easily reachable.4. Voice quality is crisp and the BT range is commendable even without a straight line of sight.5. Bass/Sound quality is average, however device equalizers can be configured for extra bass or treble.6. The pairing process was a breeze on iPhone X and S8.7. Volume is high enough for crowdedCons:1. No vibration in the neckband2. No dual device pairing3. Mediocre bass4. No native App for device management

This is one of the best products i have used and is better than the earlier model which im using for more than 18  months now without any issues. The brand is economical and reliable. This is my second purchase in past 18 months. Old one is still running as good as new with no issues. I see many other bluetooth headsets are there with losing one site after a few months of use but i did not find that with this mode. This mode charges very quickly and lasts more than 48 hours standby. Anyone can go for this.

Very good product at the price of Rs 999/-. I used it for more than 6 months. Sound quality is superb compared to the other branded products in its range. Built quality is also good. I've used boat rockerz also which delivers more bass than required. One who really loves extra bass has to choose Boat rockerz. Boult is better than many of its competitors. After a full charge (1.5 hr) we can use it for min 5 hours continuously. Bluetooth connectivity range is good & more than 10 meters in open area, but gets distracted at home between rooms. Pairing with devices is a little issue. Some times it gets paired in second attempt. Overall it's a great product.

I'm writing this review after ordering a return for this product.Though I'm really happy with the sound quality and looks of this product which I bought during sale for a really reasonable price of 1299/-, I am unable to use this to play the game I wanted to play with this earphone.Pros:Amazing sound quality (8/10)Really good battery backup (10/10)Premium look (7.5/10)Ease of use (8/10)Cons:Left side sound is coming from right and vice-versa, so if you're planning to use it for games or direction specific sound usage, don't buy this (or maybe I just got a defective product).I can't really find any other draw-backs of this product and feeling really sad that I have to return it.To Boult Audio: Your product would have been the best guys but there is a reason why left and right side is marked and you guys did a pretty bad job at that. Hopefully, next time you guys will do better.

I have used it since 2 years. The sound quality is more better than boat rockerz, even better than over the head ones. Love the battery life. It lasts for 2 years for me. Easy charge, in 2 hours it's ready to accompany u whole day. Best class bass and sound clarity. Best sound cancellation. Just the con was with mic, as it's open, hence It will get a lot of surrounding noise with ur voice. So u need to be at a quite place to use it... It's best in that scenario.

Before buying this product pls read the negative comments first ,Battery drain faster, Some times call doesn't connect to bluetooth, we need to change the options to ear piece and speak with it.

The product quality is very poor. It is not working after 1 month of purchasing then I make complaint they picked up after a long follow up and after that they returned me after almost one month. Then after some days it was not working. When I make complaint now they are saying send this cheap product by courier. I asked them why should I pay courier charges then they are saying one side courier charges pay by customer.Third class service. My suggestion is who wants to but this product is don't buy .

Got new item was very well in condition... but within couple of days got it auto disconnect & connecting issue. So I ordered for replacement with the same one. Very unfortunately I received one that does not match like the first one in physical condition... It looks like a serviced item that been disassembled... Also the wire clips are not Green that should be like the first one i received... I m not happy with this treatment...

I had tried couple of other neckbands around this price point. This one is at par with other top selling brands. Good sound quality with adequate bass. It is good value for money. One thing I did not like is the button pad which could have been built / integrated into the body. Otherwise I am liking it. Have used for about 90 min each for last 3 days during jogging, and it still have juice after the first charging.

Sound is okay kind. Battery backup is as promised.Purchaed on 17 Nov...Its barely 3 weeks old and it's not switching on or charging.Customer support is 3rd grade, needed a reminder in fbm to respond 6 days after raising the ticket. Then I was told that I need to ship it to Delhi. Current status - got an update on 11th Dec tht they hv received the product...no update thereon.Not a great product or after sales service

Bad product. Had to order replacement because the locks were loose. The product is not worth buying. I was using boult curve pro bass (not x) before this and that was terrific product. This one is costly with lesser features. No vibration on connection, disconnection and incoming call. Also super slow connectivity. But the delivery and replacement were prompt. Good job amazon and shame to  boult.

Lightweight so you forget you are wearing it. ... No cord tangles so easy to use while driving.  Bluetooth range is not so good. But didn't like vibrator button.  Very annoying vibration feature - the neckband rattles whenever a call comes, making you regret buying this, they shouldn't have bothered with that vibration feature, it's ridiculous, the build quality of the switches is not that good, feels very cheap, looks okay but feels cheapThe sound quality is good , bass ok and mids are ok.Noise cancellation is good

Having a name of ProBass, one would expect good performance in Bass but it is just normal. I dont expect performance the same as the wired headphones but they are not even 50% of the wired headphones. I got these headphones for work and doing calls so its fine for my purpose but for the people who are looking for music, maybe look for alternatives. The headphones are loud enough though, overall good buy.

I just received my earphones yesterday. So sharing my experience from a days use. Before this I was using boult curve earphones.  I was really impressed by it and it was working good for me. Unfortunately I lost it somewhere so this time I ordered the upgraded version of curve i.e curve pro. I must say after a days use. I am not disappointed. I am not a music wizard or something. Just a normal human who uses earphones for music and call function. I must say that this earphone is really value for money. For the money I paid the features and quality is quite good. I had compared a lot of earphones wch my friends have with this. Most of the times this earphone sounded better than the expensive ones like noise or Skullcandy. So my opinion based on my usage is that you can go ahead with this particular earphones if you don't want to spend crazy amount of money on earphones alone. I wud say it far exceeded my expectations. Thanks boult. You have earned a loyal customer. So now wenever any friends ask me wch earphones to go for.. guess my suggestion to them.. BOULT!!Will update more in the coming weeks based on usage experience.

BOULT Neckband proved to be quite a good Buy for Me!* Loud sound with the neckband is quite a Gain!* Battery backup is pretty great.  Minimum 8 hours battery backup is guaranteed with continuous use!* Adjustable chord feature rock.Song change option is very helpful.* But no bass so good beats cant be experienced!* Voice cancellation is not very good.* Ear buds are loose.overall ok bye for me and the I think there are better options available in the market

It stopped charging in 2 months.... They replied my non-stop email after 6-7 months & asked to send it back. After more 2-3 months they sent back the same defected piece. Now what to do? It was even in guarantee but it's of no use. They don't care once they got money. Who to complain? I still have that same earphones... Total money waste. They could have changed or replaced but they didn't bother. So, stop buying from them. Let them learn customers' after sale service.

On the 11th months of its uses the left side earpiece stopped working and I was under impression that my warrenty got overed and I didn't send it for the replacement which was my mistake, but after a month somehow I found the invoice and checked it the neckband passes two days of being one year old. I reached out to the customer care and asked them to repair it, to which I will pay the money for the service(paid service) but they said after 1 year they can do nothing. They should have a team who can look after the product which doesn't comes under the warranty by charging the service cost. Indirectly they told me to throw the earphone.

Below average quality. THIS IS THE WORST COMPANY EVER I'VE SEEN. WORST PRODUCT QUALITY. IT FEELS LIKE A CHEAP CHINESE EARPHONE THAT ARE SOLD IN MARKET FOR Rs150- Rs200. My right side earphone stopped working I've sent it to service centre, they took about 20 days and about after 25 days I got my earphone back but they forgot to send the rubber attached on earphone which is the main part of earphone ,I complained about it but no response and again after 10 days right side earphone stopped working and again I've to send it to service centre, further I'll update after I receive my ear phone back from service center

Boult Audio ProBass CurvePro Neckband is really a nice product. The sound is pretty cool and there is a reasonable amount of mic noise cancellation also, which I liked a lot. Since I will be using it mainly for conferencing purposes, this is very useful. The music quality is also very good. But the battery life is really bad. Boult should improve the battery.

 Its a go for bluetooth headset in a price range of 700-800. If price is higher than this than go for another version of boult bluetooth headset.> The Boult pro-bass bluetooth headset it actually the best in under ₹1000 headset. It has better noise cancellation feature. It has got feature to receive/disconnect call, change track, volume +/- and pause music.> Once full charged you can use for one whole single day and still you will be left with 40% of the charge. But it will keep on prompting to connect it with charger which is annoying.> It fits well in the ears and also do not hurt when used for longer period of time.> It has magnet at back side of ear piece.> It takes about an hour to charge full. There is an indicator which turns blue from red when charged to the full.

I bought one for my wife and it works flawless. But the one which I bought for me doesn't vibrate when call arrives. I don't understand why. Sound quality is good. Noise cancellation isn't that great, well that's what I wanted when I drive through busy traffic for a safe drive. We need to hear honks and I could hear even when I'm on call, where as on the other hand the caller can hear my voice clearly. Overall it's a good deal.

Functional and decent sound while music being played. However bass is low and treble is high. Could not change this setting. Compared to Boat wireless Bluetooth , the volume setting is also lower.Love the design though and the red/black combination. Sturdy build. Voice calls are good. I retained this over the boat only because this has an incoming call vibration alert that Boat did not have. For music I don't use this as the sound is average at best but works great for voice calls. Got a good deal at 949 INR.Battery life is also good and so far in a month I have charged it 4 times. So good standby times too.The volume and stop/play buttons are a tad loose and are in the left ear side by design. So it took a few days to get used to as Boat has them on the right side. But they are all functional.Good value buy if you need a wireless to take calls and play that occasional music.

1st I received a faulty product for which Bluetooth range is very low. You keep mobile in pocket and audio was getting disconnected.I replaced it with another on and thos one is having range of 20-25 feets. So it depends on your luck which product you receive.Audio bass quality is very good. Even battery is more than 24 hrs backup.Amazon replacement policy is very good I received replaced item next day only.

This is a month reviewThis product is good for people who aren’t tech savvy as it’s really easy to use and very easy to connect. Sound quality is good enough and does have noise cancellation. It is more for clear music than bass. I have bought this for my mom who has a poco f1 and the plus volume on the wireless earphones doesn’t work but the other buttons work. I’ve connected it to other devices it works really smooth. So I guess some devices may not support some audio functions. Also when charging from 50% it will charge from 0 to 100 so you need to drain the entire battery and then charge. Otherwise the product is really good for 1299.

Pros and ConsAdvantages1. Quality stereo output2. Best bluetooth connectivity3. More than 10 hours battery utilization4. Adjustable probe5. Magnet sensible speakers.6. Perfect mic.7. Water resistantDis advantages1. Unable to feel 3D audio. Even some low price unbranded ear phones gives good 3D audio effect. But this branded device can't give that much of quqlity.2. Uncomfortable for ear. If i move my head slightly, ear phone fell down from ear. Always, I should be concious on my ear, even I listening music / on attending phone calls. It disturbs my enjoyment.3. User interface not covinient. If I press lower button, volume 'll increase and If i press uppper button, volume goes to decrease. Buttons placed wrongly. It should be - upper button for increase and lower button for decrease. So, not convinient.Not best but good one! 😊

Awesome product i have ever buy in this range.. very best sound & bass quality. The in built microwoofer in this device make this a unique product from others. You think that it is a new brand so how can you believe in this but once again you think that time to time new new brand appears with new new innovations & in that brand they provide first time a in built microwoofer that makes sound very bassy that the most music lovers wants. So, don't hesitate to buy it. Sometimes when you go away more than 7 to 8 meters from the device the bluetooth may be not function. And while playing music the sound of this device squeak continuously. So tell the company about this so that they can fix this problem as soon as possible. But overall from my point of view it is very best product because I have a experience of using this. Thank you.

I can say the best earphones to buy in its range, works well and doesn't irritate the ears even at high or max volume, best in quality and best in its class for the bass, better than boat, it will be the best earphones for the people who don't love too much of bass and the quality of the material is so well compared to the cost of the earphones and the earphones in its range. If you really ready to buy and have a trail, just go right away and buy it, but the only problem is does not get connected fast as other blutooth earphones

A decent wireless Bluetooth product. Charging time is good enough and charge lasts for entire day (I mainly use it to answer calls)The main concern for me is that the earbuds do not fit properly and after prolonged use, it gets painful because of their weird shape. Therefore noise cancellation is also poor.. since the fit is not proper.Another concern is the range - which is too small. It loses connection if I walk away 5-7feet from phone so I have to carry my phone with me to another room.The magnet at the back of the earbuds is fun and nice feature. Another good feature is that it is sweat proof and splashproof (but not sure about it in rainy conditions) - you can wipe off the sweat etc with a cloth.Overall decent product, serves purpose of handsfree usage especially when you are running, walking or cycling. Thereby freeing you from entangled earphone wires.

Battery performance, sound quality is great, the mic is a little weak, listeners complain that sound coming from a far distance so I'll have to physically hold it closer to speak. Rest Bluetooth started acting up in 4 months, which got fixed under the warranty. I just had to courier it back to the company that cost me 90 rupees + a week and got it back as new, I'm impressed with the battery performance, Bluetooth connectivity, and also sound quality though.

Noise cancellation is the only thing worthwhile in these headphones. The product looks flimsy and class and regality missing from it. I don't think I can use it roughly. Also, the buttons don't feel premium to use.Connectivity is another problem. If you are moving, the connection looses frequently and it feels like that you are listening to some broken radio.Bass is missing. The voice is however clear, when sometimes the headphones work.

For the price they are selling this earphone, it's a steal. It's so sturdy, I don't how many times I have carelessly thrown this in an attempt to keep it but the material it is made out of is just amazing, besides it stays on your neck and doesn't fall off when you're off to fast run or high jumps or even burpees. I wanted record songs via this earphone as well but that doesn't come out to be great, it's pretty decent as product but don't expect way too much. Also the noise cancellation is pretty good, good for gaming purposes as well.

I haven't recharged yet since buying it a month back. Came with 80% battery and its now at 60% battery. Used atleast 10 hrs in total (used it only when necessary and not frequently used). Connects to bluetooth in few seconds. Liked the product very much. Never used for listening music though, good for attending meetings. Its good to go for this instead of cheaper ones (I tried that too and settled with this). Recommendable product.

The bass is excellent (5/5) as well as the battery (4.5/5) . Noise cancellation is good as well (4/5). The best thing about the product is its design (5/5). It fits beautifully and adds no weight on your neck or ears. The earpiece are metallic which give it an elegant look.Now, as far as seller is considered I bought it from Appario retails. I read a few reviews about refurbishd products being sold but went ahead a bought one for myself. However, I too received a refurbishd product. The seal was broken. I used it for some days as I thought maybe it will be alright product but the mic stopped working after 3 hours of use. There was lot of issue with call connectivity. The other person couldn't hear my voice properly. I sounded like a robot. Rest everything was excellent. So I placed a replacement request. I will update as soon as I get the replacement. Otherwise the product was awesome.Update:- So I received the replacement product but again the seal was broken and the mic had the same problem. Therefore, I have requested for a refund.Also I forgot to mention that when I used the earphone I felt a bit of headache due to radiation. As soon as I turned the earphone off, my head felt much lighter. At first, I thought that it was only me feeling it but then I read one of the reviews who had said the same thing. That is the reason I mentioned it now.

First of all I just loved the handsfree the minute I opened the box... then tried the calls good quality of reception on the handsfree then tried the music and i was just stunned with the quality of music and all detailed sounds emitted thru the handsfree... love at first sight and love forever after trying it.... just awesome.... only thing is I did not receive the manual inside the box.... thats ok just had to figure out things about charging time and led colors for charging period.... I have been using a few bluetooth handsfree before this one so it was easy for me to figure out things...... really coolest handsfree amongst all that I have used till date..... will buy one more for my wife in a few days.

Totally satisfied with the product, giving me more than 12 hrs of backup battery. Easy to carry and you can hide this band in your collar. Good voice cancelation. Excellent bass with Cristal clear crispy sound. 5/5 score. I was little bit confused before buying between boat and boult but this boult is excellent and i am very much satisfied.Options:Answer or cut the call with one click.Volume Increase or decrease button.Play or pause while listening to music.Seperate Ring sound in earphones while you getting the call.Size adjust.While  connecting Bluetooth you can hear connect and disconnect confirmation voice.

The wireless headphones are actually good.Sound quality is greatNoise cancellation is fineBass is also fineThe design seems a bit odd while using for the first time as the earplugs wire goes in thebmain headset. But it doesnt hinder the usage.The connectivity is smooth.Its actually way better than other headphones in this segment. I truly loved the purchase. Even the after sale service is awesome. They provide a number for registering the product for warranty. Very smooth registration process.Edited after 10 days useThe headphone got damaged within first 10 days. It stuck at on mode and were not getting switched off. The battery then obviously gets drained within few hours. So basically its always on now.When contacted the customer care they wanted me to send it through courier at my own cost. Frankly I dint feel like spending more money on this useless item.

Overall a decent package for light use but not for full day use with calls etc.I've been using it for last 6 months and see that it might not be useful for much longer as the battery retention has already dropped to 3-4 hrs (50% of initial performance). This won't be sufficient for those using it for full working days.Pairing with multiple devices is bit cumbersome.The sound quality is pretty good and the lightweight ear buds make it easy to keep them on. The anti slip buds ensure they don't keep falling out during mild activities.The mic has a decent pickup in quieter environments. In open areas, I've had to pull it up close to my mouth to be heard.

Amazing sound quality with Awesome Deep Bass offered by Boult ProBass curve Neckband wireless hands-free. NCR is good. I'm writing this review after exhaustively using the product during my Air travel. The only reason to by this product, it's very compact to carry, easy to wear, light weight for the ear to enjoy music and watch movies for long duration. Battery life is also impressive & reasonable. Journey becomes more enjoyable with this piece of hands free.

Alright. So I have been using Boult ProBass Curve for over a month and would like to summarize my feedback in bullet-points to make it easy for the prospective buyers. I was thinking to buy a quality Bluetooth headset with a great performance at an affordable price for quite long and this is where my search ended. I was quite fed up of using cheap wired headsets as they used to go out of function or get snapped every now and then. Moreover, I found them getting entangled every other second making it really inconvenient to handle especially while travelling. Its that time I started feeling the need of a wireless headset and began my search. I took good time (months) to look for a good product. And, this is when I decided to purchase this item. Before purchase I devoted time to read the user's reviews (that I always do before making any purchase-small or big) and found myself convinced. Finally, I decided to go for it. Ok. So, no more essay writing :) Let me get straight to the key points:1. I bought this for 999 under Sale so saved INR 499. (it's a good saving. As Warrent Buffet says ""every penny saved is every penny earned"")2. This has great sound quality. I could not compare it against any other product because I don't have any other bluetooth headset with me :) But this will surely not let you down. It is very loud even at 80% volume level. You just cannot listen to at that level; forget about full volume. Bass is great but not outstanding to be honest but it does not disappoint either. Good thing is the sound does not distort even if you raise it to 100%. Excellent sound clarity!3. I am not a technocrat so cannot tell what are the characteristics of noise cancellation feature but you will not get to hear any external sound/noise or very very minimal that is not noticeable. So, this stands perfect at this point.4. Performs excellent while taking a call. You will a get a crystal clear voice when you make/take a call using this device. You will feel as if you are making calls directly from the mobile phone. In fact, it's even better at times when the voice from the other side is low. I really love the hands-free calling because I have to take long calls with the clients in my job.5. Battery backup is excellent!!! It can last anywhere from 10 to 11 hours. I have tested it rigorously in both audio and video usage. And, I mean it. I tested it for almost a month with day-wise log capture. Please see the detailed tracking at the end. It gets full charged in 2 hours approx.6. Bluetooth range is good. It covers a distance of 10 to 15 feet easily. It's quite enough if not good enough. My figures may be wrong. Beware! It's just my rough estimate. Haven't tested is rigorously.7. Design looks good and is very convenient to wear. The wires are adjustable as per need. This is a nice thing. Looks cool when you wear it around your neck. I chose Red color.8. Last but not the least. It comes with 1 year replacement warranty so you can sleep peacefully while enjoying your favorite music :)Judgement: Just go for it if you have a limited budget or don't want to spend a fortune on bluetooth headset. I was hesitant to spend anything beyond 1000 bucks on a bluetooth headset. It was my personal limitation.PS: Battery backup log:16 May 1 hour 15 minutes approx in the evening video play17 May 1 hour 15 minutes approx in the morning song play + WebEx call with Suneel17 May 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the afternoon song play17 May 1 hour approx in the evening video play17 May 1 hour 20 minutes approx at night video play20 May 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the morning song play20 May 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the evening video play21 May 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the morning song play21 May start 22 minutes approx video play in the eveningBattery deadTotal battery time 11 hour 12 minutes*****************************************************22 May 1 hour 35 minutes approx in the morning song play22 May 1 hour approx in the evening video play23 May 1 hour 35 minutes approx in the morning song play23 May 1 hour approx in the evening video play24 May 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the morning song play24 May 1 hour 10 minutes approx in the evening video play26 May 27 minutes approx in the evening video play27 May 1 hour 29 minutes approx in the morning song play27 May 1 hour 27 minutes approx in the evening video playTotal time 11 hr 13 minutes*******************************************************28 May 1 hour 46 minutes approx in the morning song play28 May 1 hour 17 minutes approx in the evening video play29 May 1 hour 57 minutes approx in the morning song play29 May 1 hour in the evening video play30 May 1 hour 48 minutes approx in the morning song play30 May 55 minutes approx in the evening video play31 May 1 hour 24 minutes approx in the morning song play10 hour 07 minutesBattery discharged***************************************************31 May 1 hour 12 minutes approx in the evening video play03 June 1 hour 38 minutes approx song play in the morning03 June 1 hour 17 minutes approx video play in the evening04 June 1 hour 28 minutes approx song play in the morning04 June 1 hour 11 minutes approx video play in the evening05 June 23 minutes approx video play at night06 June 1 hour 47 minutes approx song play in the morning06 June 50 minutes approx video play in the eveningTotal time 9 hour 46 minutesBattery discharged******************************************************07 June 8.34 am start song play 10.06 end 1 hour 32 minutes approx07 June 6.47 pm start video play 7.53 pm end 1 hour 10 minutes approx08 June 11.38am start song play 12.37 59 minutes approx end 2.16pm start song play 4.04 pm 1 hour 48 minutes approx end10 June 8.37 am start song play 10.14 am end 1 hour 37 minutes approx10 June 6.27 pm start video play 7.46pm end 1 hour 19 minutes approx11 June 9.10am start song play 10.51am end 1 hour 41 minutes approx11 June 6.55 pm video play 7.46pm end 51 minutes approxBatter dischargedTotal time 10 hour 57 minutes approx

I am using it for hearing music and work from home and my place is noisy. This device connects quickly, noise cancellation is effective. The most I appreciate about it is the music and call quality. The battery lasts surprisingly long, I easily get about 4 hours of continuous music. Hearing music feels awesome! It gets pretty loud, so keep volumes at reasonable levels. Voice calls are clear both ways - I can hear and they can hear me clearly even when it is the noisy evening time. Pretty cool product..But one earphone broke after using 3 months. Hope warranty part works well. Lets see. Would be updating later.

The product looks good and built quality is also fine.. but it has serious connectivity issues.. I have seen in some reviews that it works till 10 feet. it is not true.. it is troubling even when I keep the phone in pocket and walk and when kept in car, it stopped working beyond 5 feet. i didnt face any call drop/ call quality/ battery issues. sound quality is good for this price.. I am using it only while driving to answer calls.. forget about using it for gym etc, you will get seriously disappointed..

Sharing my experience after using it for several days. If you want to use it for communication purpose then this can be a good option for you. But If you are Bass Lover and want it to use for listening to music than, this is not for you.- Not So BAD, can say 90% value for money product.- Product physical Quality is Good.- The ear tip feels like plastic.- The sound quality is OK you can feel some Bass but don't expect explosive bass.- Felt issue in connectivity.- As per Manual, it needs a 5V 1A Charger, Charging it with another adapter will damage its battery life, Hope it lasts for long.

I have recently taken this device and I am very happy with it. Wanted to use it extensively before giving my review on it.Good product at reasonable price.....................Pro's :- Good quality for this price range.- Good sound quality- Comfortable ear tips. Fits all sizes easily with provided extra tips- Very light and easy to use while light work outs- Decent bass for the price range- sound clarity on high volumes is good. Less distortion on full volume. Impressed by that.- Battery backup is excellent.-Charging time is around 2 hours which is good- Magnetic end earphones are good when not in constant use.Con's:- Packaging could have been a bit better. The earphones packing was crushed at the tips. Could have been roken if not handled correctly while shipping.- Bluetooth connectivity is below par. Does not detect MI phones most of the time. Must try almost 15 times to get detected.(Hope that can be cleared with a software update or something)- the cable for the earphone could have been flat cable . Its only subjective.- position of the led indicator is not right considering that we must look at it for connectivity.- Eventhough the earphones are magnetic, they do not power off the device when attracted.- I would have preferred more bass and less treble

I purchased in the month of October 2020, after few months the two ear buds are not working. When I contacted the customer care and returned it on 18.06.2021, but till today I.e. 29.07.2021 I didn't get it back.I have contacted through email so many mails but they just reply with a msg within 3-4 days you will get your one. But that 3-4 days never come. I am facing so many problems with this boult audio. The customer care never connects, if luckily connected we have to wait minimal time of half an hour, after waiting for half an hour it says your number is 1,  after 1 or two mins the call will disconnect automatically. No other option but we have to try the customer care n number of times and repeat the above half an hour process and action will be taken. Very bad 👎customer care, and after sales services, I never recommend to buy any product from boult, if you buy you will be clean bould........

Used it for a month almost,Connection: Its good, drops in between when >8mSound: Bass is okay, nothing to be fond of. Mids are pretty good, Lows could be better. Overall, it has a balanced sound, better than boat if you aren't a ""basshead"".Looks: Average 😂Build: Thats something impressive, at this price point it satisfies.Battery: Perhaps the strongest point. Easily gives 8-10hrs on full charge on mixed usage (music + online classes)Value: At this price range, it is pretty VFMConclusion: Can go for 1+ BWZ, Boat 335, but at this budget, i think this one's pretty good.

Cons:The product was ordered as a gift for my son's birthday. Upon opening, i was disppointed to know that the headest not at all detecting in Bluetooth devices. Kept overnight for charging just to ensure that it might have less charged. However it remained as it is. Sent for replacement and received the new one which was received very fast. The new headset is working fine.Pros:Sound quality is goodCalling is also goodThese are initial impression with the use of one week. Need to see the performance over the period after use.

Quick delivery,received with in 48 hours.Headphone overall  quality is excellent,sound quality is very good but more bass would be appreciated.I like snug & comfortable fitting of neck band around neck..I particularly like the way Headphone wire/cable fitting ,its start near the ear(near about middle of the neck band) instead of at the end of neck band & that is more comfortable while exercising as hanging wires are behind the eye sight.

Very disappointed with the quality of sound. Purchased it based on lots of reviews but when used it turned out to be a damp squib. Bass was non existent. Switched from my iPhone to an Android device just to be sure yet the result was the same. I was using the highest bit rate songs and the same songs sound much better on my Boat and JBLs.The good thing is its range was much better than most earphones I have tried almost 5-8 meters in the house. Its sound is good for conversations.

Firstly, you won't hear ANY BASS sound. I had a much better experience from my wired headset where i used to hear background tracks in videos, but using this piece, i hear only vocals, NO background bass sound at all!Secondly you would think it's voice is good, hence it would be decent for calling purpose, but unfortunately the microphone doesn't work properly, so i have to keep my mobile's microphones near my mouth while talking on phone! What's the point of having bluetooth earpiece if you can't roam around n talk without having to hold your mobile!! Disappointed! Go for a better brand with bass and microphone.Only pro - battery, but nothing else as a bluetooth earphone piece!!

I bought this after I used another one for 6 months. It was good. But this time I am cheated. Product is having compliant.It is getting disconnected in every 2 minutes.It is under warranty period and I had lodged a complaint. Still not attended from last 30days. Customer service number does not get connected, it makes us hold for 20 minutes and later gets disconnected. So I will conclude that customer service is not good and if the product you are getting is good you will be lucky. Thank you.

For my use its perfect. I wanted an earphone for calls. It's my third pair of this earphone so far. It's never disappointed me.For most people it has a decent sound. Some even liked it's sound even better than my KZ's , RHA and even Shures. I still don't understand how and why. To be very honest for me, these earphone sound pathetic but I still love them when I am on calls even while riding a bike, these have worked for me.

As i purchased this Bluetooth earphone in 899 rs i am giving my opinion about this productThe sound quality is good but not bestThe mids and high frequency response is very good but bass is just okIf u are a heavy bass lover i strongly recommend to not buy this but if u want to listen clear music in balanced audio with every detail so u can look for it but again i will say overall music quality is good not best but in 899 i think its a very good dealThe sound is very similar to other 400 - 700 rs wired earphonesOk now i will talk about PUBGSo i played many matches in many modsAnd I don't face any lag or delay ( latency )My phone is asus Zenfone max pro M2Its performing very good in pubgBattery is good but call quality is not good its mic captures more noise than a 400 rupees wired earphones so u can't talk clearly even in normal noiseDesign, comfort everything is ok

I bought it, and returned because of battery issue, and got a replacement, that replacement product was already opened, used or repaired product, why i am saying this bcoz logo of brand was faded, and some scratches was there on the earpeace, accessories was missing. So i returned it back and got the money back. Thany to Amazon.Quality of the sound was decent, battery back up was good, built quality was poor, not worthy product in this price segment 899/- now i am using Infinity glide-133 that is much batter this one.

The only unconfirmed thing is how to replace the worn ouy lithium ion battery, till now the product seems to be working OK with only problem of blue tooth connectivity, once we move about 20 feet from the mobile phone I could hear jitters in the sound due to making and breaking of blue tooth connection.Otherwise product is worth buying, I liked the blue tooth sensor to be in the neck band and not in the head as RF rays are quite harmful in prolonged use, here RF rays are a bit away from our head.

Disappointed big time. One in two calls there is no Audio audible from the person speaking on the other side. Whether its an outgoing call or incoming call doesn't matter. 50% failure rate. I need to disconnect and call again. I dont know of this is standard issue across the product or only with the one I have. But disappointed. Otherwise product is good. Good sound, Bass etc. But call connectivity is pretty bad.

While the earphones are super light, with superior design and very premium looking, the audio keeps getting patchy after 2 hours of listening (so the claim of 10 hours of battery doesn't hold true!) My assumption is that as the battery drains, the sound keeps breaking intermittently. But too early to say.The first piece I got a week ago had these issues and I thought it was a faulty, so exchanged it for a new piece. This one is one day old and has the same problem. I think I will charge it for 2-3 hours and try again.Will update the review after a month of use.The audio accentuates the bass and I'm not a huge fan. Got it for the sweat resistant feature which is great for workouts.

You must be thinking why 5 star for all. As per reality it should be 3-4 but when was the last time you purchased a wireless Bluetooth neck band headset.. packing looks royal. Sound, man the best in 1299..Battery almost 1-2 days without charging.. I noticed without turning it off and 75% volume it runs upto 20 hours.Now every one has atleast 1500 to spend on shopping out of their monthly salary.Compared all different headset and found this one to be best in looks design and light weight. Some time I don't feel like I have it on my neck.I felt bad when I experienced and later found that the product was out of stock after my purchase .Amazing Amazon product cheers to the seller.. now no money to buy again.. but happy with my purchase..Thanks to my wife for this Lovely gift..

I've used Sony BT 650 in the past and own a Bose QC II also, can undoubtedly say that this product is a perfect match of MID VOCAL CLARITY, adequate bass matching the treble, and undistorted listening experience at high volumes. I researched a lot prior to buying this and compared to MI, Realme, Song C400, and found to be the most valued for money. Call clarity is also good.Only concern is how the product receive warranty resolution, if any, in future. Boult is an Indian setup, though this is made in china, but engineering control is Indian, hence go for this guys and support Indian companies.

1: Better than boat rockerz 255(in sound clarity and overall quality).2: I like the Charging port location.3: Small in size (so you can wear under the helmet, not recommended)4: Some time finding -ve button is an issue(it will be good if they add more texture)5: While music is going on and you want to enable Google assistance, ideally we long-press the middle button until we hear Google assistant sound but it goes off. It is not long-press, slightly shorter than long-press, but you will be habituated after using.6: I doubt it is Bluetooth 5.0.

Packing :The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely. The packing itself looks premium and Classy.Box contents :Boult audio earphones, a small USB cable to charge, user manual, warranty card (1year) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips (small and large).First impression :The earphones look very elegant. Feels very light in hands. You can feel the premiumness of the Neckband once you take it in hand. The neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear. The ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard. The earpieces can be attached by the magnets. The magnet is good enough to hold them tight. The color of the earpiece looks good and gives kind of premium look.Sound quality :The sound quality of these earphones is amazing.The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone.These earphones have noise cancellation which works good. The volume level on these earphones is high.Buttons :Buttons are placed on the left side of the neckband.We get 1 multifunctional Power button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off. you can also attend the calls and end the calls by a single Press. While playing the music you can pause/play by a single press.You can adjust the volume by the Volume up & Down buttons.Connectivity :Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the Curve until the light blinks red & Blue.Turn On Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired. also, you can hear the audio that you are being connected to.Battery:In terms of battery, the Neckband simply out beats any other products. It provides 10-12 hours of Battery back up at a single charge. Which is super awesome.

Initially, the microphone of the headsets was not working at all. I had the product registered for warranty, so I created an issue for warranty claim which repairs/replaces the product according to their policy.Firstly, I had to courier the product myself to their service center. Then i had to wait for more than 48 hours for them to dispatch my product. ( Product takes 2-5 more days to get delivered after dispatch)After they dispatched the product, someone from Boult called me and asked me to DELETE THE REVIEW that I had previously left for the product on Amazon. I told him I would be okay with that when I receive the product back and if I'm satisfied with it. He told me that I have to do it right now as it is a part of the process. He even made me take screenshots of the review being deleted and asked me to WhatsApp them to him ( unprofessional enough?) I did that just because I didn't  want them to cancel the delivery of the product.Few days later I received the product back, it was not the same that I had sent ( no issues they must have replaced it) but that refurbished piece looks like it has been used before, it has scratches on it, the colour has faded and the whole piece makes unexceptionally weird vibration sound when I turn it on.For my brand new, unused product, they have given me a horribly replaced product with some dust lodged into some corners, a faded colour, the whole neck piece out of shape and a glued on earphone net ( the silver net thing covering the opening of the earphone ear piece) which obviously fell off as soon as I used it.The microphone works though :)

These earphones stopped working after 3 months. When I got a replacement from Boult, the replaced ones were also not working after few days. I complained again to Boult Customer Care to get my issue fixed, but they are not replying since then. I have dropped multiple emails to them though! Worst customer satisfaction/service ever!------ 20-Jul-2021 : No updates received from csmtr care yet. Worst cstmr service ever! They just want to make money.

It's been quite some time since I bought it, but I haven't used it much due to various problems. 1. It doesn't feel comfortable in the ears. 2. The audio isn't crisp and the bass makes it worse. 3. Within a few days of use, the sound on on side automatically decreased, and I have to make manual adjustments in the equaliser to listen to anything. I couldn't return it because the period of return has already passed, and I only bought it for gym use, so I used it sparingly. 4. It's painful to use after 20-30 mins.There are only two good things about it - 1. The interface is easy to use and the battery is good enough. 2. It's waterproof (sweat resistant at least) and dustproof.But do Not rush into buying it. Even cheaper ones from Boat are much better. Be careful

For first 3 to 4 months, the performance was satisfactory. But now after 6 months I see the defects cropping up. It's highly irritating that Suddenly the other side can't listen to you and you have to restart this earphone again to talk. This is happening frequently now... Let me see how the warranty works here

In the beginning I was little disappointed as the delivery is done in 10 days from the date of order which is not expected from amazon.But after using it for 2 days I found this to be a good earphone. Sound quality is good with decent bass.Battery back up is great (using it for 2 days & it is still at 60%) although I am not a full time user but still after this much of usage if it is at 60% then I think it has to be charged once a week.It can connect 2 devices simultaneously (I connected my laptop & phone with it) and mutes other while using one. I feel it gives a bit of a trouble when I receive a call on whatsapp when connected to 2 devices. Maybe it didn't recognize it properly but still have to use it more to get the right facts. Overall it's a nice wireless earphone.Edit: updating my review after 4 months reducing it to 1 star from 4.My headset stops working suddenly while using it after 4 months. Now as it has 1 year warranty I contacted(or try to contact) customer care. But they are not responding on email. After having a luck I'm able to talk to one guy & he sent me an email to register my complaint again on a link he sent me on email but guess what the upload functionality of page where you needs to upload your invoice didn't work. It's been a week & I'm struggling to get my headset repair/replaced. So think before you buy it, as a good product is a waste if you can't repair it

Build Quality: Enough Flexibility.Ear buds: Best in Quality, Soft and easy to adjustable like iphone head phones.Sound Quality: It sound is really good. You will feel like sound is coming from multiple directions. As they recommend its 3D that really works.Bluetooth Connectivity: Connectivity is really good. I am talking from two days no one complained that your voice is low or noisy. So its noise cancellation is also good.Overall: I have used Ptron evo 8hr that was also good but noise cancellation was not that good in that. I would recommend this (Boult Probass Curve)product to buy. Its great in its price and value for your money. Support is also nice they called me to know the feedback of this product.

I purchased this item in December 2020, in April 2021 it is not working. It is not getting charged even after charging for long time. One year warranty is there in the product. Don’t know where to claim and how to go for it. Overall it’s poor buy from Amazon.Further to this , I registered my complaints on boult audio website they tried to close the complaints without providing any solution and written a mail to me that product is out of warranty. While purchasing this product it was clearly mentioned 1 year warranty. Extremely poor after sales services as well product quality . I would recommend  don’t buy these product , many other good options are available in this range.

The product is good. The issue I observed is the following:1. The first set recived, left side was not working properly. Got replacement quickly.2. The switching mode music to phone call was generating noise. Disconnect/connect Bluetooth was fixing the problem.3. The volume of call comapare to call was low. So while listening music if call comes you would get louder call audio.  Need to reduce volume.Finally returned product.Just for listening music or call is good but not for both.

I purchased this product approx 3 months back and impressed with its performance. This is really an awesome Bluetooth for the price range and music connectivity is truly amazing. Best in class 👌.  I'm using it on daily basis it's very comfortable and durable as well. The only issue which I faced is that it's magnetic part open from earbud.Earlier I purchased BOAT and the quality of that was worse. Voice clarity of BOAT is also not good.Totally a budget gadget in decent price with awesome performance 👌

There was a problem with the mic sensitivity after a week or so and customer service was used to solve the issue. But after sending it to the service center and getting it repaired the voice prompt response disappeared and the model got downgraded. The product i bought was pro and i got back normal version.Informed the customer care again and send the product again back to the service center. Same issues not solved. Got a call from the customer care executive asking the details explained him everything he told me will check and call back Asap been weeks no response.

This is too overrated in Reviews  the device disconnects every 30 mins. Too much noise variations while speaking for other person.Battery life is good but defeats the basic purpose of Bluetooth since it disconnects very often and yes the range ia only 6 feet max. It disconnects immediately after that.Don't buy this buy branded product even if reviews are lower since atleast they function as mentioned.This is waste of money.

The earphones looks good...  the build is of plasticThe buttons in the neckband looks good and feels goodThe connectivity of the neckband is ok.. its getting connected easily to two devices... but when i away from the device (like in the other room) the connection breaks.The battery back-up is ok .. it takes around 2-3 hours to charge fully ... but one issue with this is that we will be able to use the device only till the battery is 30% and when the battery percentage hits 30% itself the announcement for recharge headset appears and the announcement repeats every one minute..and finally  shuts down the set in 5 mins. So the usable battery is only from 100% to 30%. Thats something i felt bad. But for its price these I kind of expected something like this. the company is saying 12 hrs back-up.. I experienced a back-up of around 8-9 hrs when continuously used.Overall the product is good.

I bought it at a discounted price, used it for few months but then it started giving some weird noise like magnets were loose inside. Then, it also stopped. I raised request under warranty, was asked to send back at my cost and i took time due to pandemic. Now it stopped working completely, trying to contact them but not even authorizing the return and finally, while i was trying to get support, it is now out of warranty.. without a reply from there. So, though the company has a good name, warranty support is kuist like any other delhi companies.

I was using Bould Audio Curve earphones without any complaints for 3 years. I was so happy with it, that I decided to go for the same brand and upgrade to the CurvePro model. But this was such a disappointment:-1. Constant crackling noise after every few hours when using with a laptop.2. Lip syncing issue when watching videos on mobile.3. Sound quality is average, Mic performance is poor.4. Battery didn't last as long as the product claimed.The built was good quality and better than the Curve model, but that's of no use if I am not going to be able to use them as earphones.

 Well boult Audio pro bass curve has bass but it's not proBattery lasts 8-10 hoursAbout 1hr is required to charge completelyDurability is fine enoughLast but not least sound quality ia not so good it bursts at full volume.Call and mic function is fine.Bluetooth connectivity have no issue.I have also used boat rockers 255 R and it has better sound quality but lesser bass and battery.Overall disadvantage of buying such device online is you cannot return it and you also get confused of what to buy and you also cannot check quality before buying.So I will recommend to buy offline if you are a music lover and you can buy online if you want to buy for normal works .

All my previous bluetooth headsets,  had one problem and that was the other party couldn't hear me. I figured out that this is normal for headsets that have mic sitting closer to ear than mouth. Having said that, this probass curve pro is perfect for calls! I have no complains about music as well. The bass is not overwhelming and these can be kept on for long hours without hurting ears. The vibration feature is good ,especially if you are away from your phone or in noisy environment. However the only con is that it cannot be disabled. Overall I will recommend this purchase.

For watching a web series, listening to a song it's awesome. But for calling it's worst.Noise cancellation is too bad that, sometimes the other person me to come in silent place.Each time I have to switch off Bluetooth mode, if I am in a crowded space.Recently I noticed that after picking up a call it will take 2/3 seconds to connect with voice.

I got this for my parents as a way to call without keeping the phone on them, and believe me I would much rather use the phones speakers than this garbage.Right out of the box you can tell this was made to hit a price point because packaging and build material is absolutely horrible.The second you turn it on and the sound comes saying Switching off, the audio quality can be finalized as below average. Sure I bought this to make phone calls but try playing music and you would probably just throw your phone away.After hearing that music sucks you'd expect atleast the Call quality to be good, but it's not. The speaker says my mic sounds like there's a fan in front of my mouth, and on my side it sounds like they have a cloth on their mic.Pairing process is unnecessarily long and pathetic.Overall I'd say this product wouldn't even be worth it if given away for free. Just check other brands because this one is more of a get me for less money but I actually suck type of headphones.

Cons-Poor connectivity- if you put your mobile into your pant pocket and you keeps walking and if accidently you block left side piece of blutooth(where buttons are attached) then voice you are listening gets brocken. This was shocking for me. So I tried some other brand blutooth with my friends, but they had not such issue.Poor blutooth range- range is very short guys and even if you cross single wall of your room then also voice breaks.Blutooth wire- The wire of blutooth is very thin guys which is not much strong. It would be good if it had quite thick wire.Pros-*Excellent Battery back up*Vibration notification for calls*lightweight*One year warrenty (not sure about service centre, the number they have given on Amazon site is not valid )

Don't go with negetive reviews, it is an excellent bt earphone at this price range. I got in 999 lightning deal. NO REVERSE STERIO ISSUE AT ALL. Just perfect.Pros : Affordable price with uncompromisied quality. Nice highs, decent mids, excellent bass punches, with loud sound. Very good build with comfy design. Bluetooth 4.2 connects so fast and no Inturraption at all. Full charge in max 1hr 30 mins, constant music or video playback for 8 hours. 12 hours standby with moderate use in 70% volume. I can use 3 days in avg 8 hours connected state, with full charge.Cons : Travel case which was mentioned is not provided they should have provided. Wires can ne more stronger for longer use.

I bought Boult Audio ProBass CurvePro Bluetooth Earphones and had to immediately write about it so help others not buy it.1. Neckband is flimsy and inconveniently delicate.2. Audio volume starts high. It hurts the ears. It does not save the last used settings.2. Sound this outputs is unnatural and strange. I thought some problem with the earphones.3. Fails to pair on several occasions. I had to try again and again to pair it.4. Does not switch off easily even after disconnecting. It lacks even the auto switch off feature when the ear phones are magnetically coupled.Totally, a waste product. Not Recommended to buy.

The product is no where nearby what I expected. The main reason I chose this over boat Rockerz (which I had already purchased) is because I saw some review mentioning Boult has better bass and good noise cancelling. But I am very disappointed with it. Unfortunately, during my purchase I didn't notice that I can only replace but not return. I purchased this for my WFH use, but now I have just repacked it back in the case and threw it with my rarely used other electronic devices. My ultimate suggestion, if you want true bass or atleast a bit of noise cancellation(which they claim), don't go for this.

I regret replacing my previous PTron headphones with this one. It never connects with two devices smoothly. Even if it connects and I attend a call on laptop, it gives lot of trouble to connect with mobile again. Most of the time person on other side never gets my voice. I have to disconnect and reconnect 2 3 times during live call.

Writing this review just after using 3days.I was looking for a good BT neckband that should work well with mobile calls and also with laptop for office meetings. This product meets my need. It connects easily with both the devices at the same time. Dual pairing feature works so cool. Much helpful.Call clarity - very good.Mic quality - Excellent.(not yet tested outdoors)Battery backup - powers for 9hrs usage.Bass quality - Seems decent.( I don't use much for music but for only calls)Build quality - Light weight. But Button are little loose and mobile.One disappointment - The 1st piece sent to me was having a damaged charging port. But Amazon replaced it with new item in two days. The replacement is at good condition so far.Overall - Happy purchase.

Product sound quality is good. but it stopped working after 2 recharges. does not get charged due to which it has become a junk for me. unfortunately, it stopped working just after return policy ended. When contacted manufacturere, their response is very slow. though they seem to be trying to help, they want the faulty product to be shipped back to them at my cost. also, during Covid, i am expected to visit courier services and pay from my pocket to return the product to them. once done, they might send a replacement but all hassles and cost to me for their faulty product. Not at all happy.

Decent product, battery life is good, audio quality can be way better, stylish as well as good looks, will check for longetivity as i doubt it will last long coz build quality could have been much better at this price pointEdit after few months of usage: headphones are crap and stopped working after few days. No pickup arranged from boult audio ( pathetic service) i had to send the headphones. Even after sending the earphones they tookk almost a month to provide the same  earphone in completely banged up box and was not even repaired completely i will recommend u stay away from this brand due to service

Wasn't sure between Boat and Boult at first. I had used Boat products before and they had extreme bass, to the point where the whole sound was muffled by bass. I had never used a Boult product before, but heard people say they have a balanced sound signature. So went for it, and I knew I made the right choice the moment i plugged 'em in and played some music. I am writing this review after 3 whole days of usage.Pros:-1. Quite more balanced sound when compared to Boat products. Vocals and instruments are crisp and clear. This doesn't mean it doesn't offer bass, but that it offers the right amount of bass. And the bass offered is thumpy and deep, pleasing to listen to.2. The tilted earbuds design sits in the ear easily and without falling off. They can be used for hours and hours on end without any pain or discomfort.3. Cable manager along with the neckband is an useful feature and is brilliantly designed.4. Mic is very nice. On calls, the other person can hear loud and clear, without you having to move the mic in front of your mouth.Cons:-1. For audiophiles, it still is bass heavy.2. Build quality does not give confidence. The button area is shaky. The wires are thin. This is an area where Boult needs to improve.Battery and charging - It easily crosses the 8 hour mark on continuous usage and even goes on further. Charging from 0 to 100% takes around 90 mins.Verdict :-1. If you are a basshead and love crazy bass, go for Boat eyes closed and you will love it.2. If listening to music with a balanced sound is a priority, go for this.3. If you need headphones mainly for making calls, buy this Boult because the mic is good, and battery life is better than Boat.

I've replaced and returned this product twice as it has manufacturing defect that when you call the other person, he/she can't hear you. You need to put your call on speaker and then switch to Bluetooth then only the other person can hear. Rest was ok but since it was not serving the basic purpose I replaced and returned the box pack new headphones twice. Be careful to check all such feature when you order it within the prescribed return period of 8-10 days.

Packing :The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely...Connectivity :Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.Battery: battery backyis too good.The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.Sound quality :Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.there are no concerns according to me till now .I'll update when something goes wrong.Update !!!So im using this product for almost 1 month and found no major issues .As i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.Its such a great gift Bluetooth for me.

Its more than worth to buy it. Excellent design and specially sound quality is Amazing. I compared it with MI bluetooth of my friend. I found its sound quality is much much better and also volume is more than that of it. Anyone can go for it without any hesitation. And of course, you are getting boult company branded item which is never bad anyhow. I am fond of boult products. They sell original products and sturdy too.Edited on 14.08.19 I bought one more in black. Its realy really good. I got in 999 during sale this time. Thank you so much.

Qualities:: This product is actually ridiculously awesome....This has a standard and professional sound quality and a long battery life....The bass is really perfect....Boult is stunning....As mentioned above it is sweat proof and one of the best thing I got from Amazon...When I buyed it, it had a lightning deal and I got this for 899/-But even though the price increases to 2000/- it actually worth it....And best for watching movies....I spend hours watching them...And also to listen to music....Best for calling*Where it lacks*According to me I am a singer and I sings in smule app it doesn't do much clear recording as compared to wired earphones.Sometimes when we accidentally drop it down the end cap of it where the buttons are placed breaks into 2 but it is fixable we can reattach it again.......But as compared to its good quality go bad it is an awesome product......Go ahead and just buy it...

Average built.. and it can be better for the asking price. No manual or instruction to use the features.. searching in Google for instructions ..I haven't experienced the bass - the way it's advertised... It's normal bass onlySeem decent mic...

Packing :The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.Box contents :Boult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warranty) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).First impression :The earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kind of premium look.Connectivity :Pairing your Boult with your mobile is very easy.Battery:The battery backup is good on this, we can easily get 12 hours of play time through this earphones.Boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.

The package seal was taken off (the picture is included) . I have been using Boult earphones for as long as 3 years and suggested the same to many people. It was the first time i saw it without lamination on the earbuds and lots of scratches. Seems like the earphones are not original and if its original then it's been a used one as well.Sound quality is average. Bluetooth range is average.I returned the product for an exchange and to my wonder everything about the new product was different from the last one including the packaging, earphones, sound quality, tampering seal, earbuds , controls  and everything. The later product is original as I said I have been using this earphones for few years. ( pictures included as well) There should be some action against such sellers.

1) Looks wise so good and very stylish. My neck size in Dia is a bit larger still neck band sits good enough. Ear piece connecting wire length is adjustable.2) Sound quality is satisfactory but not great especially bass.3) Connectivity is very fast and you can listen a voice command for switch on, switch off, connected and disconnected along with a vibration.4) Charging is at good speed. Fist time it took 1 hour for full charge. Need to check on further usage.Battery backup is also pretty good on first 3 days. Company claiming 6 hours but I got more than that. Let's check after several usage.5) on mobile icon is showing Bluetooth connectivity along with battery level. It's pretty good feature.

I AM WIRITING A GENUINE REVIEW FOR THE BUYERS. I RECEIVED A USED PRODUCT. FULL OF SCRATCHES AND ALSO EAR WAX IN THE EARPIECES. THE ACCESORY PACKET WAS TORN AND FULL OF SCRATCHES. ALSO ONE SIDE OF THE EARPHONE WAS NOT WORKING PROPERLY WHICH SEEMS TO BE A DEFECTIVE CONNECTION. THE SELLER IS SENDING USED EARPHONES FOR THIS HIGH PRICE AND ALSO THERE IS NO OPTION FOR RETURN. I WILL HAVE TO MOVE TO CONSUMER COURT IF THE THERE IS EVEN A BIT OF PROBLEM IN MY ORDER REPLACEMENT. DO NOT BUY THESE EARPHONES FROM THIS SELLER.

I have already used boult audio curve two yr back and I was impressed with the sound quality. In between I had other bluetooth headset but it did not match the boult curve.

Bass quality is soft and powerful, most powerful quality I have ever noticed... For such a low price. But connectivity is weak... Really weak...And battery drains even when not used....

I am writing this review after 8 months of use. No problem encountered so far..I bought this at ₹900. I have used skullcandy and JBL earlier but found it better in terms of sound quality. The band is light and comfy. It works for about a range of 10-14 feet depending on the obstacles. It connects easily through bluetooth with my nokia phone and my laptop, and can be connected to both simultaneously. Charges in 1-1.5 hrs completely and gives a battery backup of about 6 hrs. One thing that can be improved upon is that it keeps giving you warning when 30% battery is remaining and shuts down at 20%.

Writing this note after 3days of use. So here is my first impression. I am basically a bike rider. Ordered this one because of my rides and during cardio activity. While pricing is good at 999 and bass effect is worth the money, it fails very badly when it comes to Bluetooth connectivity. In spite of having the mobile in my pocket, the damn thing has such a shaky connectivity, u only here a few words of a track. It is mortifying to have such a Bluetooth device. I am going to test for a couple of days and see it off if problem persists.

.This is a very fabulous product.. It's battery life and mic is super fabulous.Sound quality is GREAT. Just the noise cancellation is not there but that is a positive things because many accidents are caused due to noise cancellation. Super fabulous product at this range especially for meetings and online classes. Bluetooth connectivity is very strong and provides 8meters connective range. Battery life for attending meetings is 5-6Hrs. and playback time is 5hrs. It's a must buy product!Although i got twice problem with circuit and got rectified by service center. the service center is quick and to supportive

For the price this is an excellent neckband. Audio quality is good compared to others in this price bracket. Battery is rated to give 12 hrs of juice, in my normal usage it definitely gives 10 to 11 hrs. Lightweight and earpiece angle design perfectly fits. All in all an excellent value for money bluetooth wireless neckband.

Got it last yearRegarding sound there is no complain, good for its priceBut regarding quality and service it's 3rd classBought last year, worked well for around six months but after that it refused to turn onAs it was under warranty I placed a replacement request which was fulfilled.But the replacement product itself was a repaired product and not a new one. Netting of one earpiece was falling off.I complained regarding that but no response.Since no response I started using the product as there was no other choice.But now this product is giving the same issue as the first product before replacement.Take my advice and don't buy it.

The product stopped being detected right on 16 th day. Have raised a compliant. Otherwise overall a good product. Will get back on the customer service. Have raised a ticket for the warranty.They reached out to me over mail sheet multiple followups asking me to send the defective product to their office. Had to pay 300Rs to send it.(from Blr to Delhi). Then I received a replacement which worked absolutely fine for 15to 19 daysAnd now it's not switching on at all.....I am not spending money to return it to and fro..... It's already 1500, the original cost plus 300 for the courier.Next time I have decided not to buy any electronic item online.....instead can go to a nearby shop to take it so that in case you encounter a problem also, we can just jump in to the shop... To claim warranty

Talking about the built, looks and design - it looks premium and stylish and very light on neck. Also it is very well built and doesn't seem like it is going to get damaged any time soon.Sound- The sound seems pretty good for the price. The bass is good. Vocals are crisp and clear. The sound volume is quite high.Battery- it gives a back up of around 6 hrs on full charge with regular calls and multimedia usage. And takes around 1.5-2 hrs to charge completely.Package - the packaging of the earphones is also very good and looks like a premium one.What I didn't like is the earbuds. This might not be a problem with everyone but with me it causes some sort of earache sometimes on continuous usage.Overall it is a good value for money product and can be bought if you like it.

Guys earphone is quite okay, not so great but somehow if you have purchased the product which i did and after few month if you face any issue then be ready to experience worst after sale service. After two month of usage left side earbud stopped working so i decided to lodge the complain to claim the warranty by visiting their website. After 48hr of complaint one of the manager or some head called me and said we are providing gift to those who write reviews and i was able to sense he was indirectly asking to write a good review. I said i lodge complaint as one side stopped working. He said they will look into the matter and revert back on whatsapp. After 2 to 3 days when texted him to know exactly how much time they need to resolve the issue for which he has no reply and never replied back. And today as of 5th feb again i got the call asking for the review. Dont fall prey to boult by seeing good advertisement.

I got this pair after my JBL bluetooth headphones suddenly went missing. I got a super price of 1399/- from Amazon and the audio is simply stunning! It pairs in a flash and has excellent battery life. Super lightweight so you forget you are wearing it. No cord tangles so easy to use while driving. Waterproof/ sweat-proof for rough use. Nice solid bass and great sound quality with passive noise cancellation.Strongly recommended for anyone needing a stylish hands free headphone  which doesn't blow a hole in your pocket yet sounds like pro audio. I'm loving it!

Very good in range (20 Meters they mentioned)  Almost True. But little bit sync. problem in dual pairing.Light Weight.

Suggestion for boult need to bring  which should have 40-50hrs backup.

I had ordered this product on November 9, 2020, and received the same on November 11, 2020. However, it being a gift for a friend of mine, I didn't test if the device was working or not (to keep the packaging untampered).  Having received it on 23rd November 2020, my friend discovered that the mic was not functional. Since the return window closed on November 18, 2020, Amazon was not ready to help me with the refund or replacement procedure, despite my Prime membership and this being a ""Prime Fulfilled"" product.Nevertheless, keeping in view the one-year warranty on this neckband I communicated with Boult Audio over e-mail (they do not respond over the phone) and demanded a replacement or refund. Accordingly, the defective neckband was couriered from my end on November 28, 2020, via DTDC and on December 5, 2020, I received a parcel from Boult Audio containing the repaired neckband (not a replacement) in a transparent pouch placed inside a  black cardboard box (instead of the original Booult Audio packaging), a charging cable and two additional rubber tips and silicon ear loops.  This time, there was no trace of the user manual or warranty card received during my purchase from Amazon.Now, I wanted to make sure that this time my friend is handed over the earphone in good working condition and went on to test the same.  In this process, I discovered that though the mic is working just fine, after using the neckband for about 1.5hrs, the blue light starts flashing and this interferes with some of the functions like ""play/pause"" music, ""play next/previous track"" etc. At this point, if I switch off the neckband and put it on charge for some time, it again works normally for 1.5 hrs, following which the same problem recurs. However, restarting the neckband or re-pairing it with some other device (other than the one with which it was hitherto paired) in response to the blinking blue light, prompts an almost glitch-free functioning, though the blue light keeps on blinking. Now this bothers me because I am totally in the dark as to what the flashing blue light implies and how to deal with it.I communicated the same to the support team on December 6, 2020, only to find my mail remaining unanswered till the moment I am submitting this review.Keeping in mind the company goodwill, they should have replaced (which I demanded from the very beginning of my communication with their support team), instead of repairing the defective neckband when its a newly purchased product and within the warranty period as well. Even if it is repaired, the same should be sent to the customer with all the items in the original package (viz. neckband earphone, charging cable, user manual, warranty card and extra rubber ear tips and earloops). But this company didn't bother to send the third and fourth items (user manual and warranty card) and that too without offering any explanation for the same.This had been my first ever purchase from Boult Audio as also of a Bluetooth neckband. But unfortunately, the experience would serve as a lesson for me to think twice before purchasing any Boult Audio product, let alone recommending the same to my friends and family.

Good sound quality but backup is not more than 8-9hours. Once beeps for low battery it does not last for more than 1 and a half mins to switch off, this should be for a bit higher time so as to finish some urgent calling.Suitable for music. While using for a call over Laptop and phone, our sound is a bit different and volume for the audience is low. Have tried this over MS Teams and phone calls with the same observation.

The only reason I got these:1. Sits perfectly on the neck2. Cable length can be reduced.3. Fares well in terms of durability4. Type C charging & that too fastWhat sucks:Sound quality.

Not comfortable on ears.

Overall these are good for the price range. I got it for 1200/-. If you find it above that please don’t buy. There are other good options.Sound quality is crisp and clear.Bass is average. Strictly not for bass lovers.Call quality is very good.Build quality is average. Neckband is fine but wires for earphones  seems delicate to me.Battery life is excellent. They really have good standby time. I use them for 1-2 hours daily. And still they last 4-5 days while connected all the time to my phone.Good for iphones as they have AAC codec which is only codec supported by iphones. So connectivity is seemless and stable unlike SBC or LDAC codecs.

With smartphones becoming highly sought after gadgets in the Indian home, similar demand for affordable earbuds has also followed suit. And there’s nothing harder than choosing between a pair of earphones as the market is chock full of options.  It's quite easy to end up with a pair that doesn't have good fit or sound quality or battery life.Ideally, the best earphones should offer good in-ear comfort and fit even with long sessions, great sound quality of course, and good battery life. Keeping that in mind, I've been using these newly purchased ""Boult Audio ProBass Curve Wireless"" for a week now and here is my review for the same *Rating* : 4.5 out of 5Usage:After using the earphones for the past week, I've noticed next to none issues with the product. The audio received from the bluetooth wireless is crisp and clear and at full volume, it is clear and does nor distort.*While Gaming*: While playing games like PUBG, FreeFire, COD:Mobile and many more multiplayer games using these earphones, I've never once felt any lag or distortion. They are an amazing pair to be used while gaming.Battery:I am using this earphones as I am writing this review and it has been connected to my phone for the past 5 hours and is still showing 50% battery remaining. I've used it to binge watch shows as well as for intense gaming sessions and also for music while doing other chores and I am glad to say that these wireless earphones handled my usage like a beast. I am getting an average of 10 hours of backup per day for the past week and I am satisfied with it. Also, the charging is fast and helps you get through the day with an hour of charge.Pros:+ Good Sound Quality+ No lags or distortion during gaming or watching movies+ Nice Battery Backup (8+ hours of constant use)+ Light Weight+ Easy to useCons:- Sometimes, on one of my phones, the headset sometimes disconnected randomly. However, they worked like a charm on reconnecting. I could not find what caused the issue but this is what I experienced.In conclusion, the headphones are a great fit withing the budget. There may be many headphones with competetive prices and features but I found these better than within the range of Rs. 1500 range.I hope you like my review and get the information you are looking for.

Packing :The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.Box contents :Boult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).First impression :The earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.Buttons :The brick on the right side has the buttons.We get 1 multifunctional button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off.you can also attend the calls and end the calls by single pressing them.while playing music you can pause/play by single press.You can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.Connectivity :Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.Battery:The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.Additional features :These earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating. I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.Sound quality :Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.there are no concerns according to me till now .As i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature

Boult had made a winner here. The neckband is comfortable. The battery lasted far more than any other. You can connect it to your smartphone & it'll stay connected without any disruptions even if you are not actively using it.The neckband vibrates for calls.However, Boult company has started removing this vibration feature from newer manufactured products. I think it's stupid.

i bought this in September 2019, and used mainly for calling and some music. Sound quality, look, feel, comfort all worth the price. However, after 8 months of use, i am facing charging troubles. Even after trying multiple cables, chargers and sockets, the boult charges only when it feels like it. I guess the micro-usb connection has come loose or something, but every time i have to charge i have to spend more than 5 mins to get it to light up.

I purchased this in March 2021, after few days I acknowledge that while on call it is having so much issues and voice reduction a lot. Firstly i thought it may be due to battery discharge I  charged the battery and was not much dedicated for calls using this. After Again i found the same issue and I have been complained for it before 3 weeks and till now today there is nothing happened yet.WORST SERVICE FROM BOULT AUDIO....ALSO THEY ARE A DELHI BASED CHINA IMPORTER COMPANY...DONT TRUST!

I got them for Rs. 1399 and for the price they’re actually really great.Noise cancellation is good, not the best, but given the price it’s quite niceThe highs and lows are pretty goodIt got connected pretty easily and I didn’t find any kind of trouble with connection or interference of any sort when jogging or runningBass is okayish and that’s the only downside of this earpieceOverall, for a price of 1399 it’s a good alternative compared to Boat wireless earphones

IN SHORT: If get it below 1000 ( like I did), buy it right way.IN DETAIL:PROS:1. Great product. Sound is pretty good for the price. Like I said, below 1k, this is the best.Bass is pretty good.2. Yes you cant really judge its sound with wired headphone like cx180 or something. But its pretty enjoyable.3. The fit is heavenly, causing an awesome noise isolation. Its fit is way better than Boats. Thus more sound isolation.4. Battery is pretty good. Lasted me for a full days, 24hrs on standby, with periodic music play( totaling to 5.5 hrs) and still had some charge left. Yes so the thing is you might have to recharge every 2 days in normal use. But its okay.5. If your phone/laptop supports, it shows the battery status too.6. 1 yr warranty plus 6 months extended warranty once you register the product.7. You can add two devices simultaneously. A phone and laptop is what I tried.CONS:1. The buttons/controllers are flat. Its easy to mistake one for another.2. No vibration for calls.3. The band wiggles occasionally4. Bluetooth range is pretty short. Need to carry phone within my office, else the sound stutters.So to sum up its a pretty good one for its price on offers, near 1k.Will update if anything else comes up!Thumbs up if it helped you!

The device is not powering ON and it's making wired sounds though it's OFF. Before pairing it's giving wired sounds. After charging through the cable provided it turned ON paied the device with mobile but within a meter range of the mobile phone it's giving wired sounds also while speaking the voice is breaking which is not happening with other Boat Rockers Bluetooth headphone. The product delivered is a DEFECTIVE one as the delivery was late for which already informed the Customer service of Amazon to SAI in the escalation also enquired if the product is not proper then what would be the procedure about it.Also there isn't an email intimation provided the customer service nor feedback call is been done.NOW REQUESTING AMAZON TO RETURN THE PRODUCT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE & DELIVER THE PERFECT WORKING PRODUCT.

There might be many good reviews about this product, my experience has not been so great. The first order got replaced as the previous one had an under-performing battery. The replacement got delivered in a seal opened box. Delivery boy denied taking it back and advised to contact Amazon Customer care. Customer Care team suggested to use it for few days and suggest to return if problem still exists. Below are the defects even in the replaced item;- Does not connect to two devices together. You'll have to disconnect from one and connect to the other.- Battery performance is still an issue (from 100% to 30% may last for 4-5 hours. The moment it touches 30%, you get repeated reminders every 5-10 second until it gets completely switched off. Below 30% battery lasts hardly for 10-15 mins. Hence the devices performance is to its ideal only of the battery remains charged always above 30%.

Now you might be wondering after seeing one of the images showing a broken earpiece and the title of the review, did this guy meant to write a negative review and is being sarcastic with that line? No I am not. This is most positive review I have written about any product. And about the image I've explained it below. Some key points to put would be this is a well built, sturdy, convenient and long lasting headphone. No questions about the sound quality. The part I love the most about it is that you can workout with ease wearing this bad boy. The design and structure of the headphones gives it unique advantage in terms of durability. I recently got to how well built this headphone is after one my friend just thrashed it and surprisingly not only was it working, there virtually no difference in the sound quality. You can see one of the above image to get an idea of damage that had taken place. And let me tell you significant had to taken place due to the force with which it was thrown. But after patching it little glue all is well. I think easily go for another year or so. Although most of the body is plastic what impresses me most is it's amazing build quality. It's a true bang for your buck. You could never go wrong with this headphone. Now offcourse nothing in this world can be without it's flaws. So does this one has but I feel it's a very tinee-tiny one. There used be a closure lid where the charging port exist. Obviously it broke off. But this should not ditter you from buying this headphone. Believe me I am writing this review after an year and I feel you should take it from a guy who has used it for an year because there almost no sane testing scenario that you cannot cover in a span of one year. Finally, I would just say ""go for it"" because you can never go wrong with these.PS: just finished my anniversary and still going strong with headphones 🙌

My friend suggested to buy this product which was delivered on time in beautiful packaging. It looks bright and connectivity with mobile through bluetooth was done without any challenge. I used it two days. Sound quality is good but not great, the bass is slightly low. I have another neck band product with double the price which has got excellent sound. My comments is that for addition product in low price, you can go for this or if you want to use it in 1st time, this can be a perfect

I must say guys these are the best wireless ear phones in this price ... battery backup us awesome it runs more than 8 hour  continuously.. and sound quaity is also very good .. the best thing about these ear phone are the are very light weight u don't realise it is there... and the wires of the earphones are also adjustable so u can use as much as u want (size) ...i purchased boat 255 and this ear phone and honestly these are way batter than boat ... battery backup is very good and the best thing about it.... JUST GO FOR IT ....

This product is not worthy to buy just because of its connectivity issues. Many people already reviewed it. If your pocket is 3 feet below ur neck then this will start to product errors. Music will be distorted and disconnects in between. Its a durable product good battery life and amazing sound quality but these all things are of no use if it doesnt full fill its sole purpose of wireless handsfree. At its current position they are not more than of 600rs. I bought them at 1300rs and MRP is 4500rs. Go for some other brand if you want a good connectivity

Day 1.Too much bass. Less sound clarity. If you love music running on bass, maybe you can think of it. But for other types of music, it just makes noise.They've claimed clear calls, don't believe that. With so much bass, calls will obviously not be clear.Noise cancelation was enough for me.Also, there's no return, just replacement. So I'll not recommend buying this.Don't take it, don't fall for the attractive marketing.Now that I cannot return this, I'll keep updating this review as & when I find new faults (I'm not expecting nice features, but I'll be open to that too, if at all I find any)

I am overall happy with the product though I was disappointed initially. First time when the product was delivered to me my experience was really bad. As the product i received would automatically disconnect if not in use. Within 48 hours I requested replacement and the next day i got the delivery of the product. Replacement product is working very well and am happy now.Sound quality seems to be good I would rate 4 out of 5Connectivity - is quick would rate 5 out of 5Battery life - I charge only once a day and by the time I go to bed it still has 40 to 50% juice left.  Would rate 5 out of 5form factor - is comfortable. 5 out of 5

THIS EARPHONE DID NOT DELIVER THE RESULTS AS EXPECTED.1. PRICE IS OVERRATED, SHOULD BE AROUND 500 RS ONLY.2. BLUETOOTH CONNECTION IS VERY BAD, DISCONNECT AND VOICE BREAK, YOU CAN NOT PLAY GAMES WITH THIS.3. SOUND QUALITY NOT GOOD IN THIS PRICE, SOUND LIKE A CHEAPER 200 RS EARPHONE.IF YOU WANT BLUETOOTH EARPHONE ,GO FOR ABOVE RANGE PRODUCTS AND ANOTHER BRAND. OR TRY TO BUY FROM A STORE WHERE YOU CAN PRACTICALLY LISTEN TO SOUND QUALITY.

Product build and quality is poor. Twice returned already. Had taken for WFH for conference calls and does a good job. But do not know when the piece will stop working. Every replacement is courier charge that you pay in the warranty period, effectively increasing the cost. That way it comes near to boat, which is a more reliable option, at a slightly higher cost.

The product may be good in terms of the look and feel and sound, but in my case, the basic and primary purpose is Bluetooth Wireless connectivity, which is bad. The product which I recd loses bluetooth connection beyond 4-5 feet, thus defeating the very purpose of wireless communication. If I have to keep my mobile 4-5 ft away all the time, then I rather talk on the mobile.

The earphones have great sound quality with perfect bass. They are loud and maintain really good sound quality at high volumes.The connectivity is something to look out for. They can connect easily with two devices simultaneously. I normally keep my laptop and mobile connected throughout the day, and whenever there is a call on my mobile, it automatically supersedes the music on my laptop.Noise cancellation on calls is just great. Normally is wireless earphones this is an area where we often have to compromise but not with these earphones.Overall a decent package and a value buy at 999

I'm sharing my views after using it almost one month... I think its one of the best products @ this price range.1. Sound is loud & Cristal clear - 8.5/102. Hd surround effect - 7/103. Bass - 6.5/104. Call quality - 8/105. Battery - 7/10It would be the best one if the manufacturer look into the bass effect..it would have been slighty upper side..though it delivers a decent bass effect with hd quality sound.Overall rating - 8.5/10Highly recommend..

I bought this headphone after usage of boult's bassbuds x1 wired earphone. After using for about 7 months I can say that boult's products are very reliable and value for money. I like boult for it's sound quality and superior bass thumping experience.Pros-1.The boult probass curve Bluetooth earphones have superior long lasting battery2.The connection is superfast, easy to wear3.sound quality is great4.neckband is flexible and comes with adjuster for length of earphones wire which is good, the earpiece does not fall easily it fits perfectly5. Bluetooth range is also very good almost 11 meters.6. price is reasonable.Cons-1.The only con I faced is the bass is slightly low compared to the boult bassbuds x1 maybe that must be the model difference. You will not even notice it if you are using for first time.2.Previous models was coming with heptic feedback this is not available in newer model.Verdict- If someone is looking for great value for money headphone below Rs.1500 then just go for boult you will not regret.

Purchased this on Prime Day and received the product today.  The first thing I have to say is there is NO VIBRATION AT ALL... In their descriptions, they mention that the device vibrates when we switch it on, or off or during calls. But it doesn't. I've no idea why and started looking for similar issues online, only to find that so many are complaining. Another issue I faced was the frequent disconnection i faced while watching youtube videos. Have to check with them regarding the issue and will update the review afterwards.UPDATE : They've officially removed vibration. It's just that they haven't updated their user manuals. Will share my experience on the disconnection part after few days of usage.UPDATE: After 12 days of usage, the cap on the charging port came off the device. It was so tricky in the first place. With the device being charged everyday, you'll have to regularly open the port. So it only took 12 days to come off suggesting poor build quality. Disappointing!

I recommend all of you to have one and I have already make my friends to buy this product I bought 2 product at the same time and it's the best neckband as I could say compared to each pricing and durability sounds good easy to use have a deep bass good looks stylish and most of all it last long and charging time is excellent. THANK YOU BOULT AND THANK YOU AMAZON ☺️

The earphones produce good bass but mids sound a bit repressed. The highs and lows are ok. The built quality is still strictly average with plastic. The neckband is very flexible and snaps back into shape even when twisted n turned to extreme angles. The earbuds are pretty lightlight, thanks to their plastic housings.

The Product is much more then as expected, but 1 Feature I didn't found in this is Vibration. I had that feature in my previous model. Not a big issue . Hope so only that feature is removed and the life of product will be same as compared to the old one that I bought 2 years back and it's still working very very good.

I was looking for a neckband for daily use and then I ended up checking this product in Amazon.. It was a new product and was skeptical about this after reading some reviews.. Then during a sale it was priced at 999 and I thought let me just pick it up.. First impressions - Nicely packed, looks premium, comfortable ear plugs.. I use it almost all day and wire length can be adjuste .. Sound quality - Good for phone calls and best to view Netflix/Prime videos, however not a great one to listen to music if you are a ""Bass"" fan but once you start using it you get used to it and is best with volume placed between 50-75%.. the vibration is annoying as the buttons feel plasticy and even they vibrate.. Would have been better if they provided rubber buttons or tiny rubber inserts in between.. The battery charges to 100% in an hour and even after using it quite frequently back up is good for 2-3 days.. Posting this review after using it for more than 3 months.. All in all its worth the money I paid..

Quality is good but maybe fitting is not too good.ज्यादा देर तक पहने रखने से कान दर्द करने लगता है और battery back-up ओर बेहतर किया जा सकता था charging time काफी सही है और battery back-up लगभग 10घंटे है इसके बाद 30% पर जाते ही battery का MSG बजने लगता है जिससे बहुत दिक्कत होती है।बाकी सब फिर भी ठीक है मैने 1महीना use कर  लिया है।कुछ समस्या आयेगी तो बताऊंगा।

For this price, I think this product is worth it.Sound quality is good. Connects quickly. Battery life is pretty decent and so is the noise cancellation.My headset actually broke and stopped working few days after receiving it. I wasn't too optimistic about what service I could expect.. but, just an email to the Boult online support and they got it repaired right away and under warranty.Bottom line: it's a decent product and the customer service is good too.

If You want a Bluetooth earphone with battery backup and sound quality both balanced then you should try this one.I'm reviewing this after using 1 week.Design is nice, Build quality ok ok...It should be better.Sound quality is great, No complaint about it...Yes, Bass is also here and you experience bass with little surround sound quality and this is Amazing when you're watching a movie... Believe me in watching movies or playing song ,this earphone is amazing.Battery backup is awesome...i got almost 8 hours battery backup on 4 days standby ( at 60% volume level). But You will get 8-10 hours battery backup normally all the time.And yes, Connectivity---I read many reviews about it's bad connectivity.There is more confusion about it, But Believe me I used it everywhere just for it's connectivity check- A crowded areas ,in rooms , Behind walls, I didn't experience any connectivity loss , sometimes its get disconnected behind walls for microseconds and reconnect, But it is normal in every Bluetooth earphones. It's Connectivity is Nice.Connectivity is also depends upon your phone Bluetooth Strength.So, Don't confuse about it's Connectivity.Mic and calling is awesome, mic working great, In Google Assistant sometimes it fails to catching your sound but in calling time it's working nice.I think You want a earphone with awesome sound quality along with awesome battery backup then go for it. Give it a try.Thanks ! Over and Out!!!

MRP claims to be 4999 but the build quality is not even close to it. This looks very cheap and plastic and it's irritating to keep longer around your neck.3D acoustic works fine but the sound quality is not even close to decent. Bass is poor as the product claims to be pro bass, boat 500 basic earphone produce batter bass quality than this. I liked my friend boult mus, I was very much impressed with the quality but this one from the same company gives poor quality. I checked the quality in zee app, youtube, amazon prime and high-quality Dolby sound test but nothing was making this earphones good buy. I got it for 999 in offer but still I have other options am not happy with boult. I look forward to return it.I recommend not to buy this.

I purchased this in Oct-20. It worked well till last week but all of sudden it stopped working which means it worked for around 15 months i.e. 3 months more than warranty duration of 12 months. This has happened with me for other electronic products also and common thing in all is, all are/were Made in China Products. It seems to me, there is in-built obsolescence in Chinese products thru software or hardware malfunction in such a way that it stops working after warranty period.

Hi everyone.... after a detailed search I got this earplug,  though I was confused between boat rokers and curve. But finally I bought curve bcoz of the long battery...It's the 4th day m using this earplug. And it shows 50% battery remaining.  Excellent battery backup.Then most important the bass part. I myself play bass guitar . I am a professional musician that's why I was really worried about the quality but I took a risk and ordered it.Trust me guys m not paid for this review ... trust quality is Good. It's not that at this price it's good... quality is very Good.And on it if u download the equaliser u will not be disappointed.So it's for those who r confused.... Go ahead for BOULT curve. It's very good.I have successfully registered for 6 months extended warranty through QR scanner.But I didn't understand how to register for Movie.Mic is just okay. Not that great but it works okay.Thanks Boult Audio and Amazon.

Sound quality is not up to the mark and customer care issue incident belowWhen I got my earphone it was working fine but after few days it has disconnecting issue. I contacted boult service and they told me to courier the earphones to their address (yes I had to book courier from my own money). I packed my product with original box and accessories and couriered it. After a week or two they returned a new piece but this time they sent me the product in a plastic bag (image attached) with no original accessories and original packaging.

Sound quality :Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.The vocals are good  and clear the bass quality is heavy but it's that not punchy.The call quality is also good because of the microphone .These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really highFeaturesThe earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.All over it is a good product in my first impression

The charge doesn’t last long have to recharge it quite frequently. Atleast twice per day. And even if it is on standby battery drains quickly. Sound quality is ok. No spare earbuds of different sizes are provided. So the earbuds are not comfortable for me as the size is big. Would not recommend.

Honest Review:-After using about 9 months.Pro's:--  Battery life is excellent. Can last about 2 days for normal use.- Dual connectivity.- Sound quality is kinda Good.Con's:-- Major connectivity issues with the laptop. It gets disconnected in the middle.- Not For gamers. If you're planning to purchase this for playing games like PUBG. Then, it is a big NOOO.  By using these earphones, a gamer can't tell from which side the footsteps are coming.  While gaming you can say that, even 300 Rs. ones perform better.- NOT for calls. Either you or the other side of the person can't hear sound. Never worked for me. Even after giving it to the service center.- Not For Online calls or google meetings or kind of online activities that involve you to speak. Too much of latency, even if your WIFI is good.These were the major issues I've faced even after handing it to the service center.- Other than that, for daily use just for listening to music on your mobile, is Good. No complaints on that.- Good, if you're traveling. Cause this has massive battery life. Really got impressed by this.- And at last, this also charges quick.

The sound quality and base is good. Although there is a bit delay (it is expected in bluetooth earphones). You can hear clear footsteps while playing BGMI. But the build quality is not good. The wires are extremely thin and the buttons are made of very cheap plastic.One year completed now and one earbud is damaged, I always have to vigorously shake that earbud or turn on/off frequently. Also connectivity is not that good , it connects, then immediately disconnects and then again we have to connect it manually.Overall if you want earphones with good base and sound which can last almost a year, then go for it. Otherwise there are many other options available which are better and less costlier than this.Thank you for reading, give this a like and let other people see the actual review of this product.

I bought the product for convenience and did expect an average audio quality but actually the audio quality is just ok, there is  less detail in the mids and highs, its just another one of those bass heavy earphones. I dont regret buying it because as i said i only bought it for convenience while cycling. I have my shure headphones that will satisfy my musical needs but i honestly thought these would provide me average audio experience but it is of mediocre quality. Thats just my honest opinion.

Product reached me on time,  the user interface is quite nice... And the sound quality is as per the price range.Battery back up is a little too flimsy.... 3 hours of continuous use shall drain it out completely... And takes about an hour to charge.... The charging wire is way too small.....creates unnecessary anxiety when plugged in.  Overall on an average... At this price range... Its a good product....  Been Using it for about 20 days... Yet to be dissapointed.

Im bass lover but i cant hear a deep bass in this item..sound is high, Bluetooth range is good and power backup is very good i used more than a day every time i connected with it overall it is good.plastic quality is like very local but have no physical damage and very much noise can hear End side of the caller it is only a negative actually i think it have no noise canceling.now its turned more than a year still battery backup and earphones are working perfectly and design is better than boar rockers we can listen while using helmet and sleeping there have no issue.

Excellent product... I was never expecting this premium quality headset with this price segment..Design and build quality:- looks are very premium and light when you wear it. Its very much flexible and buttons are well responsive.""Sound quality"":- really sound quality was very impressive and clear ...bass is great but not the best... it's very loud if you hear it with 100% volume...but for better experience use it 50-60% volumeBattery life :- coming to battery it's really great...it will last upto 6-7hrs if you listen it with 60-70% volume... charging time is around 1hr 40minsConnectivity is fine within 15ft distance..Finally it's really good ""value for money"" if you're interested go for it without wasting time... thumbs up Boult curve 👌👌👍

I found this device quite handy for use. The battery life is decent and it connects quickly with all types of devices. The calling with this device is above average and pretty clear. I could feel a lag of a second while talking when on skype internet calls however. There is no lag while viewing videos. A great budget bluetooth neckband to go for. For the money, the build quality is decent.

Please don't buy this earphones, my stopped working within a months. Earphones just went dead and won't charge.  The warranty for Boult brand is non existent. After multiple times calling on the customer care number is non responsive. After multiple emails sent to them , I get a reply to ship the defective product to New Delhi from Bengaluru and I am supposed to bare the shipping cost , which is 50% of the cost of the product. I will just have to throw it in Garbage.

Sound Quality- Like a Rs.70/80 roadside shop's chinese product.Bass- ""Zero bass"", I became extremely irritated when I found that poor bass sound.Noise cancellation- so so kind of- can't complaint about that.I am replacing it, will later on return & buy a different Product, perhaps JBL.2/5 my rate for the product. Boult disheartened me this time.

Absolutely dream come true.Worth every paisa i spent.Gorgeous looks awesome sound fantastic battery backup.My friends ate jealous of me for getting it at a sale .A bit of a problem with Boult Bluetooth devices, i have used 3 the battery just at 30 percentage keeps repeating low battery and shuts off ,must be a bug at least set it to 15/20 percent with just a reminder beep.

The product is not too good neither too bad. It is just okay with a decent sound quality and bass. The passive noice cancellation is okayish. The fitting is not up to the mark, the buds fall off while moving or working out. The product doesn't have a premium finish, it's a plastic body and looks kind of cheap. The battery is really good for this price. The best thing about this product is its mic. The mic captures crisp sound even in surrounding noises. Bluetooth connectivity is appreciable. Overall the product is good if you are looking for something for calls and to listen to music but if you are a music enthusiast and want better sound quality,I would not recommend buying this.

Good neckband, comfortable to wear for normal work. Not for working out. Neckband seems to move around a lot on the neck, ie does not lie in a stable position. Bluetooth connectivity is okayish but if devices is more than 5m away or have a wall or obstruction in-between there is notable flicker. Microphone is under , if hiding the neckband under powered collar or shirt call sound quality is affected. Magnets are just a gimmick and are very weak. Battery life is average can expect around 2-3 hrs of music time.

Some important highlights of Boult Probass curve q9- Good high frequency tunes.- No BASS is heard... All the claim about seperate bass driver is totally wrong...from the hearing of song,  we cannot use  this for bass music-Good for phone call conversation.- Good for indian classical,  bhakti sangeet and indian instruments which are mainly medium to high frequency music sources.-The design is sturdy.- overall 3 out of 5 stars

It's sound is loud enough and have a perfect fit in your ear though you wear a helmet while riding. Battery back up is great which lasts 2 days since full charge. The only drawback is that it don't have a required great bass (like the boat 225 or the 255) due to which even remix songs plays normally.Update after 9 months..The main thing is only the warranty.The mic have stopped working. Raised a ticket for the same with boult. They have asked to send the product to their new delhi address. After which they can check but the courier fees need to be paid by customer. Looking forward towards repair or replace soon..

My neckband started throwing issues after few months. Product was in warranty and when I reached out to boult team, they asked me to ship the product to their repair centre at my cost. I sent the product to their warehouse and it has been more than 14 days now and no response from their team in regards to the product replacement. very very pathetic customer service. Every-time I call their team, they just have one standard bot response - Wait for one more week.

honestly its a good headphone according to its price point....but i returned this earphone cuz its cant fullfill my criteria.cons-1. during play pubg it gives sound swap problem means left sound coming from right side & right sound from left earbud, which gives much problem in that type of games, so i exchange same product from amazon but alas giving same problem..so finally i shifted to sony mdr xb55ap2. there was some issue in connectivity  like when u r in much crowded place like train or bus, sound not coming properly & disconnected sometings , its bt range i guess 5-6mteters max..3. bass is below averageelse earphone is so good...mid & lows are gretter than highs.

On the last point of Increasing Volume, it increased so loud. And when you come one point below from the hight volume point then it get too low.Means difference between the 2nd highest volume  point to maximum highest point it changed drastically.It get too loud.

I came across Boult after lots of research and reviews.. was confused between boat and jbl..but then i read a bit about this product on various tech websites and youtube channels (also referred amazon customer reviews) and went for boult blue one ! Let me tell you i am really really surprised by the quality of sound it delivered !! 10 on 10 for that.. bass is bit ok for the price u give.. i purchased on summer sale so got it for 999₹ quite good deal..only con is, built quality is not as good or as strong as jbl / jabra but that was expected for the price it is offering compare to others...so one need to use it very carefully and gently...not for the mumbai local train traveller for sure :p !!Sound output-10/10Multifunctionality -9/10Value for money -9/10Bass-7.5/10Built quality-7.5/10My rating -8.5/10

I bought this as I used and liked the previous model Boult Curve. But this is not great. It vibrates very softly, sometimes I don't notice it when I'm driving at higher speeds. Most of the callers complain that my voice is not clear. If I'm driving without helmet, then I can hear the wind noise during calls/music. I sometimes hear vibrating noise during call.Good things are the ear holders hold ear pieces very well and charges very quickly.

A friend of mine recommended me this Boult Audio product.Since I have got this, I'm using it. It has a good base and sound. I am having no noise problem as well.Battery is working fine. As on 50% battery, I have used it for atleast 6 hours continue.Lightweighted, while waering in the neck it never feels that you are wearing a neck band. It feels like a part of the body. Earbuds fits easily in ears. A little problem with ears as they have a different design but its ok.I love this color of the neck band, red+ black. What a attractive combo.Overall it is a nice product and it's a plessure to have one.Worth Price product as I got this in just ₹999.

Boult Audio Curve Pro is very good as per the specifications and the performance was very impressive. Previous I had used Boult Audio Curve after a period of 2 years boult has launched a new version of Boult Audio cuve pro with vibration feature.  I am interested for this specific feature and opted for it. I like the TRANQUIL GREY color.  The performance of battery is very good. The Voice command is very smooth. Highly recommended product. I had advised my friends to purchase the same based. But suddenly is stopped getting charged. My real problem started as i habituated to it. I expect boult should give me a replacement as early as possible.  But suddenly it stopped charging for me. Raised a request to boult audio cure Pro to replace it.

I have used more than 2 Boult Earphones apart from Sennheiser, JBL and Sony. I can say Boult Audio Bass Curve Pro Gives you an output which can be compared to 3k Rs Earphones. Its worth the money. Battery life is just Awesome. I can go full day without caring for a low battery. This was an upgrade to BA Curve that i am using since past 1 yr and i can say its awesome.

I bought it and used for 3 months for workout.

The product was good. This is my3rd boult product. When they modified their design and changed the price the quality become poor. Once you sent the product for warranty, the product will not work again. I sent the product 2 times to their warehouse for repair it is dead now. After 3 days of expiring the warranty, they say like it is out of warranty. The product was delivered just 3 days before after repair. Boult warranty repair = dead product.

Build quality: Neckband quality is very good and it looks nice and wire can adjust by clip so it is more handy to use but wire quality is not good it could be better.And, Sometime I notice connectivity issue during call time but range is good.  Overall build quality I will give 7/10.Sound Quality: Sound quality is not premium but if you are using earphone for first time then it will not disappointed you. Bass is quite good.And if you before use premium earphone then you don't like it at all. But, I buy for cost of 1100 so it just ok for this price. Overall Sound quality again I will give 7/10Battery: Battery backup of this earphone is best at this price point if you are buying this under 1300. I will give 10/10 for battery backup.Vibration: Vibration alert on call is useful sometime but most of the time it fell useless and I thinking to remove it😫So, I can simply say that if your budget is around 1000 and price is nearly that then it can be a great choice.If this really helpful, Then Please hit Like🙂🙂

Does not vibrate as mentioned in the reviews.The UX varies with the product that you get, I bought 2, one has a hissing noise when there is no data transfer, has a different feed back notifications all together, other has no noise, but the feedback experience is again different.build quality is average, not outstanding, battery life is ~ 7 - 8 hrs, overall buy it if available for less than 1K else there are  better products out there.

It looks nice, built quality is good. It is very light and comfortable to wear. Battery back up is great, almost 10 plus hours on single recharge. But I didn't like two things. 1. It's bass is not good, no bumps in ear while listening songs just simple music plays more or less flat. They could have provided better sound quality. Ptrons provides better sound being cheaper than these but there battery backup is only around 4 to 5 hours.2. Bluetooth connectivity what I feel is poor, I used many headsets but in this sound breaks like mobile is away from headset even when mobile is in your pocket.Calling quality is good, you hear crispy clear sound from your caller and your voice goes very clear to the listener.

I bought this product a few 2 months ago for Rs 899. Ill say its a pretty good deal for that price. I use it for listening to music during workout and jogging. One feature which sets this product apart is its noise cancelation.  I can hardly hear anyone speak on medium volume. The quality and bass are good for the price. So far so good. I ll have to see hiw long it lasts, so say whether it was worth it.

Posting review after two days use.Product design is good. But for some reason the battery percent does not go above 90% no matter for how many you keep it on charging.There is a distortion when using with mobile hotspot on. The voice keeps getting disconnected.Not good for gaming!I would like to return if thats acceptable. Its not what I had expected.

It is 2 days use review. Will update if any issue comes. To be frank I ordered this product after careful consideration of reviews of all the bluetooth earphones under consideration. My main concern was good mic quality so that the person on other side can hear clearly and believe me I was pleasantly surprised on that front. The sound quality is really good too. Add to it the fact that it lasts more than a day with moderate usage, you have an amazing product at hand! Fully recommend over other players in the market

 Compare to Boat variant, Boult curve is the best wireless Bluetooth earphone in the market. Just go for it 😊Pros :1. Connectivity is good, when it says 10mtr, be in limit ;)2. Battery is awesome (approx 8hours continues play) and whole day battery life if you use it as and when needed without disconnecting.3. Call quality with this neckband is awesome. I didn't find anyone complaining about voice quality so far.4. Comfortable wearing, if needed you can hide it in ur shirt or t-shirt.5. Sweat proof only.6. No glitter in max volume. U get perfect output.Cons:1. To be frank this product is good, and ofcourse there will be some minor issues which can be negligible, for example, battery percentage indication in phone reduces by 10's. Say headset is 100% charged, after some usage, percentage come down directly to 90%...soon. which is not an issue.2. It's not rain proof3. That's it guys, no more consEnjoy your musicNagesh

Bought this in Sep 2019 and within 6 weeks the LED display is gone that I never know that its charging or pairing properly. The charging port is very poorly made that its not sturdy during charging. I put it on charging without knowing its charging or not. Very poor build quality. Audio quality is better but not great for phone calls. Comfortable to wear and light weight are the pros. But many cons. I am looking forward to claim warranty. No response on this review yet and no luck reaching customer care.

The earphones are extremely comfortable and easy to go with. It connects easily to multiple devices (Phone and Laptop) and works well without the connection overlapping.The neckband assures that the earphones remain in place and is not bulky at all. Almost weightless.The neckband vibrates whenever there is an incoming call, which is a useful feature at this price range.The sound is crystal clear and the earphones work well with the phone's inbuilt Dolby Sound Enhancer.Overall, an amazing product and should go for this if anyone is looking for a good and not so costly Bluetooth earphones.P.S. - The warranty provided by the company is what it claims as someone ordered this and due to some mishappening, one of the earphones lost it's sound. We contacted Boult Audio via mail and they asked us to Parcel them the defective product and asked us to wait for 3 - 4 business days. On the 5th day, he received a brand new product via Parcel as claimed by the company.Excellent Product.

Boult ProBass Curve is a good purchase and is superior to its competitors in market due to its sound quality (stereophonic) , Excellent Bass and aesthetically designed to meet customers requirement.

This product is really useless and pathetically designed. that's the reason they haven't got cancellation policy for this product after delivery. The metal over the ear-buds is so hard and placed at 60 degree angle , which makes it very inconvenient to wear and hold it over your year even for 5 minutes. the ears will start paining like anything. my advice is not to go for this product or keep on regretting it later for wasting your money.

Never buy form boult, worse experience ever,  I have bought a neckband called boult audio ProBass curve pro on 4/may/2021 from Amazon,  now the product stop working from one side, sound comes from only one side within 4 months. I have applied for the warranty, but they are telling me to send the item via courier. Why I suppose to do courier? Why can't you pick up the faulty product ? Why I spent my money for courier? Although this product is under warranty period? Is this a way to provide warranty ?Before I was suggesting people to buy boult product, and they also bought. Now I am thinking they are gonna hate me, I suggested them because I didn't know the after sell service of boult.Never buy any product of Boult.

The beauty of these product is you need to buy every year just after the warranty is over. I faced the same..within a month of warranty expired, things started wrong and the product non functional in another few days.Contact amazon, they will say bring the service denial mail from Boult. Bring that Amazon will say ..extremely sorry for this but we can’t do anything.What type of product assessment amazon doing. Or this is the business trick, buy every year.Be prime member or normal purchase…Amazon will treat you with Same respect to Sorry ..we can’t help.

I bought this for my morning runs. It worked perfectly well for the first 3 days and then stopped working.It just wouldn't charge. I requested a replacement since the replacement window was active, and Amazon promptly replaced the product.All was well for 2 weeks and again it stopped working one fine day. Wouldn't power on, won't charge.Since it was used indoors all this while, there is no question of water damage through rain.There was a time when I used Boult and those headphones lasted quite a while, but these ones are terrible.Never going to buy or recommend Boult again.Better to go wtih pTron or Boat. AVOID!

I am reviewing this almost after 2 months of usage, I own two of these and let me tell you. I brought it on a price tag of one rupee shy of 1k, for that price it is ok-ok product.When it vibrates it feel like cheap headsets, also sound ain't that great. If I wear this during running then it kinda stops working for a while until sweat dries up, so it's not exactly usable for workout if you want. Up until now, batteries are satisfactory however they could have done a better job considering the normal price they are selling this now.

Update:  It simply died on me today. Bought it in September 2019, and today it is 27th October 2020. A little more than a year's life span.Sound quality is good. You need to tweak your sound quality from your phone settings menu to get the best output for your own auditory nerve stimulation.The ear piece and neck bands are comfortable enough to listen to music for long duration. Battery lasts good as of now since it's a new product. Its consistency remains to be seen in future as it ages.For the discount price at which I purchased, I am more than happy with the product.

It is a very good bt neckband. with good call quality and good for music and phone calls. I have been using this for the past 3 months. before this, I had the none pro version (one without vibration). I still have it and it works fine. The battery for this one is better and the Vibration alert is really useful when the phone is silent and you are not near the phone. but the only problem is that when we connect 2 devices at the same time and move away from one of the device and gets disconnected neckband will keep alerting that device is disconnected. and will turn off after 2 min or so even if you are using the 2nd device.

I have purchased this product after looking at very positive reviews on Amazon and YouTube...I don't know but this product is decent. If you are a bass lover than this product is not for you. If you listen to Arijit Singh songs then it is good. At full volume your ears starts hurting becoz it's not pleasant at higher volumes. At a point you will feel like there should be some more bass in it. The earphones are loud and once you start listening to music there is great amount of noise cancelation but the sound is not pleasant. You will always reduce the volume to 80% and enjoy the music. Talking about battery life it will last for a day in moderate use. And yes the company says that give us 5 start review then they will offer us coupon but the product is not of 5 start  review. Thank you

I would like to thank Boult Audio for bringing such a marvellous product in such range. You are getting everything in it like awesome sound quality,great connectivity and robust back up. It has 20 m range and the call quality is excellent. Using it for 4 days with average use of 2 hrs daily but still it has 50% battery remaining. You are getting 100 mins of playback with 10 mins of charge. I would recommend it for sure-go for it.

First of all, I am personally using this product from last 7 Months. I Ordered this product on 20th Jan 2021.The build quality of product is very bad as compare to Boat Audio eventually the battery backup is extremely good as compare to BOAT AUDIO. But the customer support is very bad and when you raise a ticket for Warranty then for sure you have to suffer. There executives will call you and will tell you to give a good feedback to product and they tell us mention as customer care contacted me and then we have to share the screen shot with them. once you done this. That's it. after that no further actions. Congratulations you are fooled successfully by the company.Pros:-* Good Bass if song is bass boosted and Micro Woofers actually works* Extremely good battery backup* Great Look.Cons:-* Will damage soon even if you care it well* Earphone Magnets are not good.* It gives pain in ear if you use it for long time.* Bad customer support.* Vibration mechanism cannot be turn off.* Customer care tell us to give false positive reviews.* After some time you will get some audio errors like some wiered kind of vibration in earpiece

Everything is good in these Bluetooth...it is soft nice sounds. But bettery pickup is not good . If it is 100%bettery also very quickly it comes to 70 %.

Pros:1. The sound quality is so good that a little volume is enough to hear the voice clearly.2. Noice Cancellation is not cent percent.3. Thumbing bass which I didn't expected. Music lovers can solely depend on this. Need not to spend thousands of Rs. for a good BT headset. This is enough even for a heavy user.4. Battery backup is good. For an average user, a single charging is enough for 2 full days.5. The mic picks up the voice efficiently from inside of two barriers like face mask and helmet while riding.Cons:1. When the battery level reaches down to 20%, a repeated warning annoys and hinders the continuity of the hearing audio content.2. It takes a lot of time for the Battery level from 100 to 20. But within one or two minutes, it shuts down after the warning started.

Its good at this price. Sound quality, Noise cancellation, Bass quality is good. But i think for me the neckband is slightly short. The wire is not as thick as shown in the product picture. When i am using it during the time of walking the audio is not continous even in crowed area also. When using it during walking in middle of a song or call repeatedly the audio stops for a moment and the n again come. Range of the bluetooth is just 1 meter or 2 meter

Starting with the audio quality, it is clear & crisp. The vocals are also good. The voice-over phone calls is also great having the in-built microphone. It is enriched with high fidelity 3D acoustics which pours crystal clear high-quality HD audio which is pleasing to ears.The battery is boult audio Curve Pro earphone‘s most important feature. It is a true powerhouse, delivers playback time of 10-12 hours for every charge. Though the battery size is not revealed, it takes around 1 to 1.5 hours to get fully charged. It has 1-2 days of standby.Coming to the design & build quality, It is feather-like lightweight and you will never feel the burden on ears. The neckband designed earphone fits comfortably around the neck. The neckband is very smooth & cosy. The wires connecting the earbuds & band is of good quality which lasts longer.

The sound quality is good overall. However, the noise cancellation is bad as compared to other Bluetooth products, even with Boult wired headphones. The battery doesn't last as long as mentioned which isn't too much of an issue, but the sound volume and quality drop with the decrease of the headphone power level which just impacts the overall experience.

Writing this review after a month of use. The headset really has a good battery life which come to around 10 hrs. I have been using Curve for around a year now with no issues so can really trust the name Boult. CurvePro feels even more robust. Very comfortable to use and overall quality is excellent. You will never regret buying this amazing product in this price range. I recommend this to everyone who wish to buy wireless neckband.

The headset worked well until I decided to go for a jog, it started vibrating insanely until the battrey drained out, on charging the vibration erupted. I decided to raise a complaint with the company, they asked me to send back the headset and promised me to replace it with a new one if my issue was genuine. I received a tampered box 15 days later, the replacement headset too was faulty, the right earphone always kept on producing a humming sound and overheating in ears and the battrey did nt last for more than an hour. Now i again have to shell out courier charges to return the faulty piece.

My primary use was for calls and meetings. Sound quality when you listen to music is good, but Mic quality is poor. I ve used it for phone calls and zoom calls in laptop.. always the other side is not able to hear me properly. Need to shout and they still hear me feable. Note that it's not returnable.. can only be replaced.

I had purchased this product from Amazon on 9th of March, within 3 month of sparingly using the product, The Bluetooth connectivity become very inconsistent, Frequent disconnects and Now unable to connect at all.Warranty support is pathetic, Though there is a one year warranty on the product.

Boult audio probass wireless earphones are absolute crap for the price!! These are cheap chinese made, stopped working after 3 months. With multiple follow ups n wasting 200/- for courier charges was able to get replaced.it took 2 months to get replacement , quality is so pathetic that stopped working again!! This time Boult support didn't respond to warranty claims as we had lock down ,but after lock down they refused to honor warranty as it had crossed warranty period !! While most of the reputed brands extnsded warranty on their products, Boult is refused making it clear Boult product are waste of money n time!!Don't be fooled by discounts Boult product are china made n cheap quality n worst part only 1 service center in delhi

The product looks quite cool and feels good to wear but sound quality is only average. However, that was expected given the price. Something I found particularly annoying was that that the controls on the earphones only includes pause/play and volume control- you cant change songs from the earphones. Overall if you are looking to buy something on budget- it gets the job done.

After using the Realme Buds wireless for over half a year, I got the grey variant of this product for 1100 bucks in the Great Indian Festival and boy, was this a pleasant surprise.Pros:1. Great sound quality at this price, which I actually wasn't expecting. The sound has been optimised to give a good experience and there is good amount of bass and it's not overpowering. It has Bluetooth v5 so you can connect to 2 devices at the same time, which I use for connecting to my phone and laptop. Call quality on this headset is actually quite decent.2. Lightweight body makes it very easy to carry and once you wear it you feel like it's not even there. The clip to control wire length is very handy. It's got a tight fit, so it's ideal for sports. I personally think it looks really good too3. Battery life is actually quite good, I use it for 3-4 hours at a stretch and there's usually only a 20% battery drain. So you can get around 10 hours easily on this one.4. We actually get 1 year of warranty, unlike the 6 months warranty on brands like Realme etc.Cons:1. The earbuds might cause a little pain after 2-3 hours of use.2. The product packaging is not their best suite.Overall, it's a great bluetooth earphone at this point. The value for money is insane. Boult Audio did a great job with this one.

I usually dont write reviews but today am compelled to write one! It's pretty ordinary product with horrible listening experience during calls. Very very bad for calls, listening to music is still ok compared to calls but I don't recommend this product.Another important thing, do not get fooled by '7 days replacement guarantee' , this means if u don't like the product after seeing it you can't return but they will just replace with another similar item so be very careful.In addition, I have faced frequent Bluetooth disconnects.My recommendation ""DO NOT BUY"" this product unless you want to regret later.

Had picked this on the ongoing amazon sale. Wanted a wireless earphone within budget. The look feel is great, does cancel noise upto certain levels. Have used it only for 2 days. Battery life looks good, had little discomfort in ear vn used for long. Needed the length of the band a bit more. Other than that looks ok. Will have to see after prolonged use.

The set became "" dead"" after 10days from date of purchase on 10/8/2020. Boult requested to send it with all purchase documents to its service center at  Wazirpur Industrial area , New Delhi 110052.  Today I received the set back , repaired I think . It is now working although I did not receive the original box , charger cable , extra ear buds . If it runs ok , then I can say its' sound quality is fine with ample bass . Noise cancellation is ok.  Calling is also ok. I got it at 999/- and this price is ok.

Bad call quality at times first i thought it is may b coz of poor network but it can't be bad on all calls at times the peron on other hand is not able to hear even wen thers second incoming call squeaky noises come from headset really annoying. Boult should really work on this. The only good quality is battery, it lasts.

After seeing good reviews i bought this Boult earphone. It was working fine for a month, now it connects to laptop and disconnects. Initially i thought it was laptop problem, but same issue exists when i tried to connect with mobile phone. It connects and disconnects every time , so now i am not able to use  this earphone. I never thought this product will have this issue. Felt very bad as i had an option to go for other cheaper earphones, but after seeing lot of good reviews i went ahead and bought Boult. But  it looks like my decision was wrong.

Please don't buy this product,your money will be lost.The look of the product was decent, but the sound and bass quality was very poor. In this rate, you will get amazing products from JBL and Boat.First 15 days went well then suddenly its left and right unit stopped sounding from both earbuds.Neckband connected with the device but the audio is not coming from the speakers at all.Then I went to their website to claim its warranty and booked the ticket.They said that they will reply in 2-3 days.But it has been a week, no response has come, so I registered the complaint again, then the previous complaint is pending.Their service is even worse than bad.

First of all, I would like to congratulate the team for bringing in a product which meets almost all the requirements that anybody could ask for in  a wireless headphone.I received  the headphone in a very good package with all the necessary details including the warranty card. The connection processes were all simple and was done without any difficulties.I really love the headphones  for its awesome sound quality  and noise cancellation. The best part is that the microphone is great!!!Actually  I had purchased wireless headphones of another well-known brand twice , but the microphone  was not working well.But this one is a real savior and is something which you can  buy without any second thought!!Another important  feature of the product is that it switches between the connected devices without any hassle. For e.g ,when you are working on the laptop and have connected your headphone to it and suddenly if you receive a call on your mobile phone which is also paired with the device, the headphone automatically switches to the call (provided Bluetooth feature of your phone is on)and you can receive it without any delay.The only drawback I could see is that the battery backup is a bit low when compared to the rest of the features being offered and hence I would go for a 4.5 rating.This review is based on my usage of the product for about a month.Overall its a great product to buy at this price range as it delivers more!!!!

I Purchased this product on this October and with in a month, its battery backup become zero. Now I am unable to use this as it not holding charge for more than 5 minute after detaching from power adaptor.Further, the device is not detectable by any bluetooth device.As per instruction of boult support team, I sent my defective device to Boult service centre by spending Rs. 220/- as courier charge and boult returned the same device without doing any repairing. The device is still not detectable by any other bluetooth device (neither by mobile nor by laptop or any other compatible device).Under such circumstances, I am feeling being cheated by boult and will advice everyone not to buy this product.

This review after 2 days of use, I am not a professional or a tech frenzy geek or something or I haven't tried a lot of earphones for that matter, so my review is strictly based on a common guy's opinion. I was satisfied with the Sound Quality and the Bass as well. Battery backup is good so far ( around 8-9 hours), and charging time is also quick (around 70- 90 Min.). While the product is light weight and the buds fits right too, the build quality could have been better. Overall it is a product I am Happy with.PS: Will edit the review in case of any problems in the coming days.

Battery backup is amazing, I am using the neckband from past 2 months.Full charge takes 1.5 hours, after that charge on next day (works around 12-18 hours) - including active time around 8 hours , and remaining stand by time.Calling quality- Absolutely no or least noice cancellation, receiver can listen a dog bark from 20 metres away.Mic is working fine.Bluetooth range-Bluetooth range is around 7-8 metres , no audio lag . I can easily roam in house while listening music , after 3-4 walls some audio distortion.Used this during exercise , worked fine while jogging.

I had so much hope when buying this after reading all the positive reviews. I don't know how others getting such good battery life. I get about 4 hours on a full charge. There is a constant hiss. The battery low indicator starts at 30% and keeps repeating every few seconds. From that point I get only 20 minutes of listening time at best. So barely lasts me half a day. Super disappointed with the sound quality and battery life. If you feel I'm not using it the right way, point me to some documentation on tips on the right way to use it...

I ordered probass, which unpacked it after 6days, after using for 3-4 days I found the problem in the headset, that it been continuously vibrating even the call is answered, I tried to return the products but the Amazon  window was closed, so I approached service center to get supported, I couriered the brand new set with additional courier charges from Chennai to delhi, but got thr same headset without any resolution, I feel like throwing the headset and buy some other good brand :(Boult should have tested the products or replaced the product before sending the same faulty  product again :(

The product is very good.1) This is the best for workout. Even if you jump , run very fast the buds will not come out .2) The call quality was also good and nobody complained about my audio while using the curve pro.3) The sound quality is very good , very crisp sound.4) The bass is very good too.5) The vibration works well.6) You can control everything using the buttons. Works good.7) the battery back is excellent. You can use them long hours.8) You can also take the workout eartips off when you don't need it .

I would definitely recommend this product at the price it is sold at. Good sound quality. Ample bass, not damping the sound, enhances the overall quality. A major merit is the battery life, I could easily get around 12-14 hrs. It's humongous in terms of battery. A gripe would be that it tends to sound less on the left earpiece or tends to sound more on the right earpiece, can clearly distinguish the volume difference in both the earpiece (maybe only in my product). Also, a little more bass would have been a perfect finishing touch for this product. All in all, I like this product very much.Edit - No noise cancellation at all. I can clearly hear what's going around me even with 80-85% volume level. Taking a star off of the rating for this reason.

These earphones are really good at this price range (I got it for 1300). The sound quality is pretty good and clear.The neckband and earphoens are very comfortable. At times I'll forget I even have it on. The buttons are also well placed and the magnetic heads are useful to just stuck together and leave it hanging around your neck.There's no active noise cancellation. The sound isolation is pretty decent.The volume gets VERY loud. Like dangerously loud. Would not recommend listening at full volume but still is possible.Would definitely recommend this product.

Worked great for a day and half. Well, it works after that as well, but the thing is you need to press and hold the power button constantly as long as you are using the device. I had to recruit a person to assist me with pressing and holding the power button until the return agent arrived. Rest is well. Consider all alternatives ranging from 60 Rupees wired devices to whatever suits you, but do not buy this one.

Amazing product in the stated price range, Completely satisfied with my purchase and reviewing after a couple of months of usage. In fact the company is promising as working hard to collect customers feedback and improvise.Reasons to Buy:1. Durability: sturdy product, technically designed well, no problem in charging.2. Ease to use: user friendly product. Can easily put on neck and travel, fits perfectly in ear, have to loose& tight feature for earphone string3. Value for money: I have used much expensive products of price ranging between 15k to 20k, but it’s performance is comparable to that range even.4. Stylish design & colour: feels a cool look wearing it anywhere, in office or home.5. Protection: neck band is of soft flexible yet sturdy material, magnet given to cross lock the earphone with itself to protect it from dropping.6. Other salient features: light indicator on charging. Red colour when on low battery, blue on high; controls on neck band works well, pause/play, forward/backward, volume  up/ volume down, call pick up & disconnect.Scope of improvement:1. Difficult to connect multiple devices at ones2. It’s easily detected on my android devices but rarely detects on my iPhone while connecting with Bluetooth.

First things First Amazon Delivered the Product in 10 Hours Since Order without any extra chargesObservation on first use Boult Audio ProBass CurveSound Quality is Ok Ok not that good because treble is highBass is very poor feel like no bass.Bluetooth is not 5.0 it 4.2 version only.Sound Quality also Poor.No user manual provided even after spending more than 1k.I think this is a replica of Original, not Boult Original Manufactured.

To me, this is THE BEST bluetooth neckband available right now (esp. in this price range). I bought these earphones after going thru' a lot of other ones and finally decided on these.The best thing I like about this model is the ""vibration "" feature. Not many headphones have this feature though more expensive than this one! The next thing is it's awesome battery back-up and finally the matte-finish... Sound quality is good as far as the calls are concerned. Music quality could hv been a tad bit more better. All in all, a very good, sturdy bang fr the buck earphones... ☺👍🏼There are a couple of things that could have been added though:1) It would hv been very nice if it had a Type-C charging port2) Magnetic auto-pause/play would hv been a bliss...

Guys I was using Boult earbuds before and I had wonderful experience with it ( Sound quality n bass quality was awesome) so with the same expectation I bought this neckband but I had very worst experience with the sound n bass quality coz the bass is too less and if you increase the volume, bass doesn’t increase just the sound increase which makes your eardrum uncomfortable

Item is defective as every time i keep pressing the volume up button it keeps switching itself off and there is some problem with the wiring as the sound keeps jumping high and low everytime it twists, also the original product has the volume up button on top of the power switch but the delivered headphone has it opposite, also the seal on the box was not pasted correctly when i opened the parcel

First of all ,Have received well packed product and for the price i paid this is a good charging time is less and backup is really good. Listening to music is a treat even while you are riding a bike sound and volume levels are clear.. Bluetooth connectivity is ok kind..You need to speak bit louder otherwise people will complain you of low voice.No one has complained about other noise around till now. Three extra buds have been provided buds will pop out of ears initially but as you use it regularly after a week it won't..Keep in mind that I am writing this review based on the price i paid after discounts..

I bought this in a sale, so I was lucky enough to shell out only 20% of the markup price, after getting my hands on this and looking at the build and audio quality , I think its not even worth what I paid for. Either its a cheap knockoff of the original one or some thing is really wrong with this company. On second thought I now realise why this was going so cheap. My Advice- don't get fooled by the steep discounts on Amazon, if its going on a steep discount sale, there is a good reason why !!

Initially had connection problem and it used to get disconnected very often. However seems like it is working fine. When I raised the issue with Boult I didn't get much of a response. They didn't respond to my replacement request or when I tried claiming warrenty. However after many days the Boult rep called me for the feedback and kept suggesting me to write a review. Overall not a great experience.

I have been using this for nearly 10 days now. Got a good deal from Amazon, delivery was dot on time. Powered by Qualcom chipset Boult neck curve is pretty neat product. Very light weight, it easily gets wrapped below the collars in formal or neck collared t shirts, magnets helps hold together and ensures it does not slip away when not in use from your neck. Its decently comfortable on your ears and sound quality is pretty good. I have used it for Skype, Teams and phone calls on Windows 10 and Android it works perfectly fine. Range is decent , it meets my requirements as it works preety good with the range of 6-8feet which is good for my useage. The quality of wires, ear buds looks good. I got this for Rs1200 after cashback offers, definitely worth and great value for money

Its sound quality is very poor. I had to take earphone as soon as I put it in my ear, I had to take it off a while. If you increase its volume then its sound starts bursting completely. I used to call a friend, so he was listening to me more than the voice out of me and there was a quarrel in the voice so I think noise cancellation facility is not available in this earphone. I put the return request immediately and waiting revert from amazon.

I had an old Boult audio probass curve and It's worth it.I bought the new one (pro curve) with a hope that it would be better with it's quality than old.But the only difference is it's having a better battery backup.The could have  give some more bass  and sound quality. I couldn't find a better 3d acoustic as they claimBeing an audiophile I am not much satisfied with this,but the backup is ok for me and the design too.The mids are ok.Highs fineBass not as expected.

ProsGood design and build with flexible neckbandEasy to pair and easy to use for callingGood battery life (mine standby was 6+ hrs)Budget friendly under 1kNow let's soundSound level is a bit on lower sideBass is averageNoise cancellation is below averageOne touch remote pad is not very friendly in switching musicBluetooth disconnects frequently when in range of multiple devicesIf you have some more money to put go for jbl else this one is good to settle with at this price tag.

Ear buds silicon caps are good quality. They feel good in ear.Sound is also good for routine use. Does not hurt ears and neckband is comfortable to wear.The adjustment of the wires on the neckband is really helpful.Bass is okay.I felt right ear sound is low compared to Left on the 1st few day but still trying to make an opinion if these needs to be informed to company or not.Taking calls has been easy and mic is good as the voice is clear for other side. Still to try in traffic zones.Battery life has really good.Overall a very decent bluetooth wireless earphone at the price point.Cons:Storing it when not using is a challenge. Would have been great if a cloth pouch was given to store it when not using.

Guys following is my quick review Pros1) Bluetooth connectivity is very fast & quite stable so far2) Seamlessly connect to 2 devices same time & works efficiently on both  the devices.3) As of now Battery is lasting approximately for 6-7 hours with continuous play back  and still its on 50%.4) Regarding sound quality, I am a regular JBL user. But after JBL I found a quite balanced sound in this price range. Before this I used BOAT 255, but its too high on bass. This Boult has very balanced low, high and mid frequencies. I am really happy for sound quality.4) Neckband and overall fitment of product is quite comfortable. In spite of using for 3-4 hours continuously no fatigue observed.5)Noise cancellation is very effective even with 60% of volume6) Proactive customer service..now days it's rare to find itCons1) Earbud cable is little thin, need to careful handling for it2) Earbud has half portion metallic and it has little sharp edges3) No where on the box it is mentioned Bluetooth 5.0 version or exactly which version, it has same case  for multi device connectivity  even though it connects.But overall experience is surprisingly excellent in this price range. Guys you can really try it.

I'm reviewing it after 5 days of use.● Used the neck band during jogging and to my surprise it didn't fall out of my ears. Where many earbuds come out.● Music output is brilliant as well as the bass. Its simply magical.● Its really light weight. Hence doesn't jump around my neck while jogging.● Call receiving feature is also nice.● Connects to the phone instantly as soon as I switch on the product.

My last Bluetooth earphone was boult audio probass curve, it was the best in my budget and the vibration was too cool. But I lost it so I decided to buy it again but they removed the vibration feature so I looked for other brand and Boult audio probass CurvePro appeared but I thought it was the same old earphone cause the name is almost similar but the ""pro"" caught my eye so I looked at the feature and to my surprise I found it has vibration so I quickly ordered it. After I got my package I was really excited as I was sure that the sound quality would be awesome just like the old version and I stood right. This pair look better than the old pair and it was more updated.

Tried a couple of Bluetooth headsets before I decided to totally settle for this one. Loved the Boult Audio Probass Bluetooth Headset!! Great and clean sound quality. The battery lasts for over 8-9 hours maybe more but I'm super satisfied. Wearing comfort is perfect and seats comfortably around the neck with adjustable wire length to comfortably reach the ears. I totally recommended this product!!

Received the order today and in 4 hrs Mic was not working properly . And now, it is connecting good and the mic was also clear. Audio was excellent. Bass is also good. Battery life was phenomenal 👌 it's stay for all the day where I use completely for the day.Customer service from amazon was worst than ever. Even people will try to help but amazon customer service dept will say only 24hrs or 48 hrs. I understood, we are sorry. Only these sentences will repeat in n number of times. Amazon lost their credibility in terms of service. Waste of time , energy and simply customer service department will ensure you get frustrated, irritated and what not , everything. It's like they will pull your nerves out and play with it. Worst than ever.only god can help.

Very good quality as far as price is concerned. The USP is its long battery life that easily lasts throughout the day in a single charge. Sound quality is OK though not outstanding. Overall value for money. Go for it if you want to get a good Bluetooth earphone that does not worry you regarding charging.

Latest update: It stopped working just after 21 days from date of delivery. Dosent get switched on.Bought this product on recommendation of my friend, but unfortunately having bad experiences. First had issue with battery and exchaged the product within week. The replacement was worst, issues with connectivity and mic. Takes farely long time to get conncted to phone, Voice is not clearly audible/breaks to the persons otherside on the call. Suddenly get disconnected and when reconnects starts playing music automatically 🙄.Built quality is good,easy to use, ergonomically fits the ears but performance is very disappointing.Not interested anymore to exchage, feel like wasted some money on this.

Like the charging point given in the Bluetooth, it is at perfect place. I don't think we can use any other cable to charge the Bluetooth so be careful to carry the cable given with it. Oray be after few days it will become a little more Android cable friendly. Loved it! Sleek and nice

Apart from vibrating notification will find literally no pros for the product, using it from roughly a week, the earphones doesn't work as we want noticed when making calls sometimes you cannot use the earphones, and when you're already on a call you can't take another call which is on waiting, you'll be forced to lower the volume while on call as the earphones creates so much distortion one will feel like throwing it away while on a call, the sound quality while playing music is same as a generic wired  earphone costing ₹100 over that Amazon doesn't give you a option to return this product back huge disappointment.

Decent performance to start off with, when it was newly purchased. However, within a few months, issues started arising with the battery. A good 7-8 hours of charging the device would only yield in 2-3 hours worth of music. An extensive issue being that the phone would always show that the battery level of the device was at 50-60%, but you would already start to hear the low battery beeps during the music. You would expect the device to at least last a bit beyond the warranty date, but the device stopped charging about a month before the warranty expired. The sound quality was not of the highest level either, with intermittent issues occurring in bluetooth connectivity with the phone.I would not suggest these headphones given the price point, and the fact that it can't even complete its claimed warranty period.

After reading so many reviews and researching i always ended up on boult curve... I had a gut feeling that this product might be good for my budget and workout... I read negative reviews too that it wont connect properly if you jog.. Bluetooth not working fine... But I'm using it for past 3 4 days... It hasn't disconnected even if my phone was 20 25 ft away... Sound quality is good,noise cancellation too... But i would recommend that you play it in half volume cz you cannot hear whats going outside or if someone is calling you.. So overall nice product built quality is fine for this budget... If you don't have a high budget this is the best deal for you... Keep you eyes closed and buy it. :)

I have bought it last year in October,first 7month it worked fantastic but later its battery drain fastly. I contacted the customer care of Boult they really very helpful and ask me to send back.

It's really wonderful device. Bluetooth connectivity is super fast, battery life is awesome,it last more than for continuous usage and I check it out just connected to mobile ,but not playing any songs, i almost no charge is gone. To speak about sound, its supero quality and very good bass.Build quality is great, it is better than Boat Bluetooth headphone which costs similar price.

Well the connectivity was good.Voice through the micro phone was not that great.Bass was not their, treble was on a higher side.No vibration of any sort as they claim.Built quality is not the best, every time you plug in the ear buds you can make out the cheap quality used.Better to go for MI or boat.I had to return it immediately due to false commitment made in the description.

*Sound Quality: Sound quality is ok for this set but not up to the mark. Yes, it delivers a good sound but small details which it misses can be easily heard in senheisser or JBL or audio technica or Sony.*Bass: I am a thumping bass freak, this was the reason why I chose this headset. It calls itself a pro bass. But literally it doesn't have any bass. No bass at all. Choose another set if you are asking for a good bass effect.*Call quality: It is connected well to the phone and call quality and the sound on the call and video chat was good and up to the mark. I've not tested if it works on skype mobile and pc.Physical fitments: The piece fits good on neck. Feels easy and relax (for some people who starts to feel irritated will feel it ok in some time).Overall if you are buying it by reading just probass on it please don't buy it. For bass lovers this not the thing you are looking for. Don't get fooled like me by looking at the advertisement.Thank you....

Very well built. Nice audio quality. Mid range frequencies are a bit enhanced along with the bass. Adjusting this using the graphic equaliser then gave near perfect quality. Great value for money.

Bad experience with the new boult curve bt v5!!I have already owned  boult audio curve first gen neck bands (the one without vibration and without fast charging bluetooth v.4.2)Which was compaitable with old phones as well as new smartphones (bt 4 as well as bt 5).Everything was good with that product.Since its been one year the wire insulation started coming off, so I decided to go with brand again by buying new one.But I made a mistake!!The new one is bluetooth v.5 and these earphones don't support older smartphones(bt version 4 , 4.1, 4.2 phones not supported) when connected the audio keeps stuttering and the music control functions don't work with older smartphones.Also we can't put a call on hold and attend another call with this earphones. The call disconnect automatically.Contacted boult support. Send them mail, talked on phone but no use they still saying to wait till they get back to me

Guys, please don't go on this number of reviews postedSome of them might be using this for very normal usage and they might have got lucky with this product running after 10 daysHere is what I am struggling with -1. At start for few days I did like the sound quality as compare to other bluetooth earphones like boat etc2. But the earbud design is quite painful for longer time3. If you continue using them considering above point then here is another disappointment... It started to sound low after a few days (8-9 days)4. Here I am writing this review on 10th day because my volume key is now functioning into on and off functionality5. And now I am out of replacement window ...it's really irritating and frustrating from seller and Amazon tooSo moral of the story is please dont go for them just because they are cheap and there are number of users using it ..no .plz no

Although the specs and connectivity are not an issue the main problem lies with customer service, the same product was purchased in 2019 and then in 2021 both of them had the same issue of the on/off button.The button would automatically go off when pressed once with the intention of switching it on, last time product was out of warranty but this time considering the interaction from boult it seems I have to pack and courier it to Delhi, apparent customer service number does not work and is of no use.So in short if the intention is wasting money and keeping fingers crossed that it wont spoil then go ahead

Using this for the past 1 month. Pretty average product.  Nothing to boast aboutSound quality is okay. The worst part about this headphone is the Mic and the range. The MIC has to be held very close to the mouth for the other person to hear you. Range is very very bad with even minor obstacles creating a problem with the reception.

I just received these earphones today. I'm amazed by the awesome sound quality and superb bass. I'm already using JBL reflect 2 but these earphones are even better than JBL.

Good sound quality but very bad customer support.

Not even 5 months and it's giving problems... It keeps getting switched off again and again by itself even when you are on calls... Not its says battery low and when it put it on charging its showing full... When I try to turn it on and connect it is not turning onn... If I try to turn it on while charging it turns on and gets connected and battery shows 100%..when I remove the charging cord it's gets turned off... I tried to claim warranty for which I was told I need to fill a online form and post it to their repair center on my expense... If I do that then postage by Blue Dart is costing me Rs 400... I bought this for Rs 900 on Amazon sale is it worth spending half the money again only to get back the same or a similar used product? Or should I add another 400 to it and buy a new one??Would not suggest you to buy any Boult products because of their after sale support...

I already purchased the same product couple of years back and its really good. After 2 yrs, the battery life comes for 7.5 hours with continuous usage with fully charged. Approximately charging takes 1.5 hrs. So I purchased a new one for my daughter and this product is also good. I had issue in charging after 3 months. I reported the issue to the Boult and received a response with in a day with guidance to send the headset to the service center. The only draw back, I had to send this to Delhi from Bangalore with speed post of Rs.70/-. I received the acknowledgement they received the product and with in a week, I received the new product  and the ticket was closed. I am extremely satisfied with the support and the product for the money which I paid. Bluetooth coverage is good to walkaround at home.

If you are listening to music, then this is a good product. But if you are using this earphone for what's app or local calls then you will be disappointed.

Hassle free, sits on your shoulders. I dont even realise it was there all day. Bass and sound quality is great. Worth the money. Durable battery of 12 hours I barely charge once a week to come through out the week. Vibrations are cool when you get a call to alert you when the earpieces are not in use.

The charging socket on the headphone is designed in a off angle making it a struggle to charge it. And on the top, with in few times of usage, the product is broken. Their customer support number leads to a portal which asks details of invoice etc, but does not give any reference number what so ever to track your complaint. It does not provide any human interaction so you can make sure your complaint is registered. Overall, terrible product, terrible customer support. Restrain from buying this item.

I dont write reviews often. But, this device made me to tell good things about this product. This is a perfect device if you are a public transport user that too crowded ones, this bluetooth device is one for you. This made my life a lot easier commuting 50 kms each way. Though it disconnects when you cellphone moves around 5 feets away but that does not make it a bad point as the price, sound quality and build quality will make you fall in love with this earphones. I bought other bluetooth earphones previously but had to return them because of either connectivity issue or sound or build quality. This is one device i have found very useful and i have recommended it to many of my friends who all are happy about the usefullness, quality and price. You wont get any better option than this within this price range.Talking about the sound quality, it will surely not disappoint you as it provides decent bass along with nice noise cancellation that too in very crowded place. The sound is more than adequate you need in a bluetooth device.Battery backup is pretty awesome which was not at all expected. I use it saily for 3-4 hours continously mostly on the highest volume and it works for 3-4 days easily. Also in case you need to charge it, it takes hardly 2 hours to fully charge it again.Thank you boult for making my life easier.One small point - you have to use left earphones on right and right on left while playing PUBG as this gives footsteps sound opposite to left and right marked.

My first Bluetooth headphones.So here is my review after I used it for five days.Bluetooth-connects within a second(I’m using iPhone 6)Bluetooth range-20-30m if there is no solid/concrete wall in between.it works even if u move to the next room but won’t work if u go further rooms.so basically it’s best for gym or during workout in a space with no walls in between.On/off,volume keys-easy to use.works fine.Mic-extra feature for answering callsSound-Good.u will love the sound if the audio or video is HD.Noise cancellation-GoodBattery:6-10hrs the best thing ur mobile  will show the battery icon just near ur phones battery icon.Charging-1-1.5hrsI wud say in this price u getting good quality headphones.Go for it.ignore the dislikes.

The 5.0 bluetooth version of Boult Curve Audio gives only 6 -7 hrs of battery backup whereas the earlier 4.1 bluetooth gave more than this. . I really liked the earlier product which is used for 1 year so ordered the same for second time, but they have lacked the consistency...The packaging box was tampered and seal was broken both the time and the charging cable was of a different brand . Insist amazon to take stringent action against this. Won't recommend this product to buy anymore.

It was not comfortable and the neckband wasnt very good. If you just love sound i recommend you to buy this. While if you give comfort your priority then please think before buying it. It was a good product.

Disconnects frequentlyThe are bunch of thieves and liarsThe product had some problems so i contacted the support team. They asked me to courier complete accessories as recieved in original box. After repairing the product they returned me the headphone only in an ordinary box.I called and told them the issue.. but their representative replied that it might have happened by mistake. By mistake? How by mistake..?  if you ask for original accessories then you should have a cheklist to be used while returning the same.I also mailed them reffering my ticket number.. in reply they just sent me a new ticket no and after that nothing happend.. now it is nearly one month i didnt hear anything from them..So be wise..The headphone is also not so goodIn one year i had to send it two times to repair.. i have spent around 3 hundred on courier.One more thing.. they say that they dont repair the product... the replace as they replacement warranty but they first repiar the product and then send to you.

Box contents : Earphones, a very short USB cable to charge, warranty card (1 year warranty) and 2 pairs of extra ear buds (small and large).Headset material and design: Headphone is very light and comfortable to wear around neck, also its design where we can adjust the length of headphone wires makes it more comfortable and less tangly. The ear piece is made of metal and have magnet lock which is good enough to hold the ear piece together. Ear piece fit well in the ears so they won't fall even if you are walking, jogging or doing work out. Great dust resistance and decent water resistance so good for gym enthusiasts too.Buttons :On the left side we have 3 buttons.We get 1 middle multifunctional button and 2 volume buttons which can be used to change soundtrack also. Button are made of hard plastic and are little loose (you can hear rattling sound when you soflty tap on button or shake the headphone). Not that high quality, but no operational problems noticed yet.Connectivity :Bluetooth 5.0 gives you long range and easier connectivity which i liked a lot.Battery: AWESOME BATTERY, we can easily play songs 12 hrs in single charge.Sound quality : Sound quality is amazing. AWESOME BASS, clear vocals. You won't hear anything from outside once you start playing songs.The mic quality is good, other can hear your voice clearly even if you are in crowded area.Best headphone for this price range.

*Note: I bought these earphones thrice just to test how good the call quality is*If you are buying this to listen to music then I may recommend this but if you are buying this to make phone calls, then please get ready to appoint a personal doctor to repair your ears. These earphones have zero noise cancellation. It rather HYPER AMPLIFIES the sound surrounding you. The voice quality is garbage and you might start hating the other person on call (talking to you via these earphones). Please do not buy these for the sake of making calls.

I had an issue that I heard the ambience and my voice through my earpiece at the very first time connecting a call. After that it's been good one for the money paid. Sound quality is good. Automatic pairing with my mobile is good enough but doesn't pair with my android TV. The way it fits into the ear is perfect and it kinda serves as a passive noise canceling a bit.Edit: After seven months of usage, now it does not get charged above 30% every time. I'm using the boult audio cable only and the same adapter since the first day of usage. Now it's started to behave like this. Hate this product. Without juice, it's of no use of having a better sound quality. There's a one year warranty for this product. Gonna file the complaint and will update afterwards.

Very convenient product. I use it in my office n home as well and its so comfortable and convenient to use and the voice clarity is also awesome. Its so hassle- free that you no longer have to bother to look around for your phone when it rings. On lighter side you can also keep your phone safely away from kids.

Delivered very much in time, the packaging & product unwrapping was great experience , All mentioned items were in place, its a Chinese product though. The sound quality of the earbuds is amazingly good, specially the Bass. The neck band also is very flexible & easy fit.The only short coming was the blue tooth range, it mentions a 10 meters in the specs (approx 30 feet) , but the voice of incoming calls start to distort at 10 feet range, also the music starts to get distorted & several disturbances can be heard. For effective performance pls stay within 10 feet of the phone at all times.

After looking so many brands with positive & negative reviews, I bought this Boult Curve wireless Neckband earphones for Rs 999/- in a sale. After using 10 days continuesly reviewing this unit. At first impression it looks premium & decent.Review is as follow :1. Battery Life ----It has 1-2 days stand by time.=> It runs 8-10 hours if you r a moderate user.=> It long lasts for 20-25 hours, if U r a normal user.It takes 2 - 2½ hours to get fully charged.2. Sound Quality----No doubt it has Punchy & Deep Bass with Balanced Treble, Surrounding Effect. You can feel/listen lows,mids,highs very clearly. Call quality is also good with mic but noise cancellation need some improvement.3. Built Quality----Built quality is very decent & looks premium. Physical buttons on left-side are very light to press. Neckband is made with some good quality of plastic so that it is very flexible. U can sleep evenafter wearing it. Earbuds r also soft. Wire quality is also nice for long lasting.4. Connectivity----Company said it works in 10 meters of range but as per personal experience it has some connectivity issues. Connection breaks if u r walking/ jogging. Connection also disturb if u r walking through one room to another even having distance less than 5 meters..So the conclusion is:You can go for it with this price range bcoz it has all the qualities mixture. Buy it if u r Deep bass lover. Long lasting battery life.It's sturdy & water resistant. It's not bulky also as it has wire adjutable hooks/lock both side, u can adjust wire length by this.Overall ranking 4 out of 5 bcoz some connectivity issues r there.

Writing review after 3 months of usage. First thing to comment the design in very thoughtful, the way the wire slides into the slot is too good.PRO:Charging time is very quick like 15 -20 min.For the charge time taken discharging is ok, easily 7 -8 hours continuous usage.Price is dam cheap.In ear pieces are very comfortableSound i don't find any issue.Mic is very good, i have had people tell me ur voice us very clear.Cons:Range on the bluetooth is very bad. Like I use it on my laptop n if I move to next room hardly 200 mts always signal starts flickering.Except for the range issue I would have rated a 5 star for the price.

It's style Also helps us to free comparing to other headsets. Thanks Boult for giving such a good hearing experiences.

Comfortable to wear, very good quality clear sound and noise cancellation for the price. Will update after a few months on the durability. Initial setup and pairing to both my Samsung phone and iPhone was quick and easy. Takes about 5 secs to pair with either when turned on. The dual connection (to my iPhone 11Pro and Samsung M30), once set up, works well, but facing occasional drops.

The item received was defective and bad.Sound does not come in one of the ear pieces. One ear piece is not working.Colour of ear buds in each ear piece is different. left ear bud is grey color and right ear bud is black color.I found there was no main plastic cover packing on the company box.I am totally unhappy with this order and the item delivered.

Very poor quality, just after I bought it I have been facing issues continuously. Turning on is a big issue right from the binning, and after a few month it stopped turning on completely. I raised a request and got it repaired. But just after about one month it stopped working again. I raised request again twice but boult is not responding yet. Verry terrible experience it would be batter to have a local year phone rather than this quality in such a cost.

I had to return the item received as the box was open already though other two sides seal were intact where it was mentioned 'if seal is broken, do not accept' and also one of the ear price was not a proper fit hence returned it. Then I received the exchange of the item and yet again as you could see the pictures, the box was open where it was mentioned 'do not accept if seal is broken' and also the earpeice cushions(large ones, don't know what they call) were provided separately which were I guess part of the earpiece and hence it becomes a useless product.  I have lost interest in using this product but it is not cancellable not I can get refund hence I am trying with the same sol same old exchange policy of this item and hoping this time the seller is cautious and takes care of the concerns else it will be a waste of money, time. Funtionwise product was good, but defective items sold by seller on Amazon and 2 returns already done by me so hoping for something good else indeed I wasted my money with this purchase.

Product is awesome. Been using it for 2 days now. Battery life is good. Audio quality is good although I feel the bass is kinda less than I expected. I have Used Boat rockerz before and it had better bass although it had less music quality.One more fact is that the volume is extremely high. Please do use this at around 50-65% volume because at full volume you can get a headache pretty soon like how I got yesterday when I Listened to songs in JioSaavn at full volume.Lastly, I am using medium size earbuds now. The small and large ones are also an option subject to your convenience.I got it for Rs. 899. Its worth for any price less than 1k.  Overall you can go for it without any worries. It should serve you well.Update after 8 months of use:-The earphone was working pretty well till recently. Two weeks back, right side of the earphone stopped working suddenly. I have raised a ticket claiming replacement or repair under 1 year warranty facility. They have raised a ticket and its being processed quickly. Nothing to worry about, because I feel they will replace/repair my product ASAP.Its still a good product nonetheless!

Two problems.... problem#1the charger provided with the headset does not work, it is not charging the headphone. Initially I thought the problem was with the headset itself. However, tried charging with another charger and it took sometime to switch on the product and connect to phone.... Problem2: i am not able switch on or off the headset. Either the buttons are not ok or some other defect. editing it to 3 star... About the headset itself

The sound is really good and great real time battery life. Only issue is as soon as it gets to 20% battery life, an annoying alert keeps coming up saying ""low battery"". It keeps repeating and interrupting while listening to music and even when your on a call. After this another 5-10min of usage and the device shuts down.

Got it for an effective price of 399 on Great India Festival. While in use the sound quality was good, fitting was good and product design was also good.But after now 6 months of usage they have stopped working. I was not able to start the device. Boult is a young company and are making good products but build quality can be better.I had initiated warranty claim and their support responded nicely.

Don't go by the 5 star reviews. One has to give good reviews of the product first in order to get Book My Show coupons. With regard to the headphones the sound quality is average with emphasize on bass but not on clarity, mids & vocal output is muffled. The Bluetooth range is very poor. Only 5 ft apart there are serious drops in call & sound quality & frequently gets disconnected. After 6 months it is totally dead. Now waiting for warranty replacement.

Boult curve wireless earphone first impression it's look premium... When I got the box, box packing is nice but in boult box very limited information provided by company.... Even they don't mention about noise cancelation or battery backup which is crucial information...When I opened the box I found earphone which looks premium I like it... One free movie ticket coupon and warranty extend card inside the box... And one charging cable which looking cheap quality but its OK..When I connected with my mobile, Its connected without any issue.... When I switch off my earphone again power on its connect automatically and very quickly without any issue.... Voice quality is good I have no issue but other person also hearing background sound also.... When you listen music sound is good but not the best... If you are bass lover then you don't go for it because it's bass is not upto mark compare to boat earphone.... Some times sound intrupting while your walking but it's rarely.... I like it's battery backup which is given around 10hrs+In my opinion I like battery backup and earphone quality

Thank you Amazon and seller it's very good product, battery life to good. 13 hours of battery remain. I also use JBL wireless earphone worth rupee around 3000 at that time, i handle JBL headphone very careful. Nevertheless Even so, his wire was damaged. When I use BOULT earphone i release BOUT best  than the JBL. JBL dange price very high and not bandu but BOUT Affordable price and product is very nice.

The reason i preferred it over some rivals is because I liked how the wires of the headphones are built on it ,I don't like the wires hanging around the side of my face ,it's nicely tucked on the band and can be adjusted to go almost behind my neck. Excellent build quality , vibration haptic feedback when someone calls is really great feature ,sound is not too loud and not too low (kind of sweet spot on 70 % volume for me ) , bass is decently good  ,it's not harsh , someone  who likes to enjoy the beats will love it but heavy bassheads might be left wanting for more . Noise cancellation is good as we cannot hear outside noise when listening to music but during a call in busy areas mic pics up nearby noise too. But then again for the price point it is value for money 💰💰💰💰💰 ......
"

The design is so cool.. The noise cancellation is also good.. But the bass quality is quite low that while listening the music the outside noise is not cut fully.. And during the call the sound sometime come slow. As u seen in second photo the colour is faded in between the one year use so it have to improve.  But one thing i personally experience faced that Boult authority tell that sir/ma'am please submit the review of product on purchased site company provides u 100 rupees cash back completely forget the hope of getting 100 rupees as a cashback.. But it's totally shame i think first u say then ignored the issue.. It's come in category of scam..

This review is based on one week usage. The build quality is good- neck band, wires and the earphone speakers. I like the ergonomics of the band, the controls and the earphone speakers, you may find that the angling of the speakers a bit peculiar but will get used to it. The sound quality is really good, I loved the sound seperation, stereo effect, tonal quality of the vocals and high frequency sound, though bass is good sometimes gets a little exaggerated. The songs don't get paused when the earphone magnets are joined. Overall very happy with the purchase

To be honest this product sucks at all level...

This product was working fine for a grand total of 3 months after which the product is not turning ON. We haven't dropped/misused the product in anyway - just regular use has caused the product to fail. This NEEDS to be fixed by the manufacturer as it falls in the warranty period. However, this company has failed to respond to any means of communication - email, twitter, phone etc. I am looking to see if they can be contacted via this medium. We really liked the sound quality and overall design. However, basic things like turning the headphones ON shouldn't fail so early on. Please invoke the procedure to get this device fixed.

The Earphones are of good quality and sound quality is also superb for general purpose listening. For those who say the sound quality is not good I want to tell them that these are not meant for audiophiles, these are useful for the people on the go. If you want studio quality sound go for some costly on ear headphones instead. I have purchased this for taking calls mainly and occasional listening to music, so it fulfills my purpose well.

So Review Hmmm,It's been around four months since I have been using those.First if you are buying a bluetooth headset then connectivity is very important, and these have been very good, there was not a single time when they got disconnected.And another thing is battery life, my smartphone would die twice or thrice but these won't.Sound quality is good upto 80% and I always use those around 60% volume and I think that's enough, that's pretty loud.Bass quality is very good at even at 60% so if you go higher then it will be awesome.I love listening to music for longer periods of time and I love those.One issue that I face is when I call someone, mic quality is very good but noise cancellation is not very good.Otherwise these are very good for the price what can you demand on such a price.I just love those.

It's a decent product for this price. Battery lasted around 6 hrs , could have been improved. The bass is little low compared to boat headphones. Bluetooth range is average. You can connect two devices, but there is a slight delay in sound playing while switching between the two devices. Also sometimes you may need to reconnect with your phone Bluetooth . Decent noice cancellation, good sound quality.

Got it within two days of ordering it, it's a gift from my mom and honestly I was really skeptical about buying any Bluetooth earphones online but this Boult CurvePro is actually pretty neat..takes a second to connect and the sound quality is top notch. It's not expensive and it's totally worth the price now I'm just gonna see how long it last cuz this is the first time I've bought earphones online and the packaging was good too. And the battery life is sufficient enough for a normal person

Its very much flexible and buttons are well responsive.""Sound quality"":- really sound quality was very impressive and clear ...bass is great but not the best... it's very loud if you hear it with 100% volume...but for better experience use it 50-60% volumeBattery life :- coming to battery it's really great...it will last upto 6-7hrs if you listen it with 60-70% volume... charging time is around 1hr 40minsConnectivity is fine within 15ft distance..Finally it's really good ""value for money"" if you're interested go for it without wasting time... thumbs up Boult curve 👌👌👍

I purchased the Boult audio true buds from Amazon and within two week of usage I faced audio issues and I reached out to Amazon but apparently the exchange portal close 2 days before I found out about the issue so thru couldn't help me out and suggested I reach out to Boult customer service and I did. After reaching out they took over a week to reach out to me and they told me to parcel them my earphones to their headquarters which is in delhi, now I stay in Mumbai and I'm not allowed to leave my house during this pandemic and they expect me to go out send the parcel, pay for that parcel and send it to Delhi? Is it my fault that your product is defective? Which stopped working in less than 2 weeks of usage. Never ever buying anything from Boult audio.Now keep in mind I also ordered Realme buds Q and after a few weeks or stopped working like expected and I replaced it and i faced the same issue again so I replaced it again and the entire process was WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!

I purchased this product last year (27 July 2019) for Rs.1,349/-. I am using it for one year and I like the product. I use it almost everyday and following are the pros and cons of the product according to me.Pros---> Very easy connectivity.--> Clear stereo sound (High, mids and lows all are good).--> Decent battery life (I generally prefer music on low volume about 30% volume so currently it works for 1 and 1/2 day for me NOT non-stop) apprx 8 hrs of battery life. Also battery life reduces with time, initially it had much better battery life. I am not sure but maybe 12-16hrsCons---> The product comes with a note saying ""give us a positive review and mail a screenshot of it and get Rs.500/- gift voucher"" (The main reason for positive reviews on the product).--> In my case, after about a month of purchase, the power button got spoilt and I got it repaired from local shop. I don't think every product will have this problem.--> Today, the left ear piece stopped working and I guess it will stop working completely soon. So, you can say the life of the product is about one 1 yr. It may turn out to be more for you if you use it less often.I would rather suggest to check out Mivi and boAt earphones which may be slightly more expensive than this but I feel you will find it worth the money. Also Mivi and boAt both are Indian brands.

Built quality is very good. Battery backup is also very good. Since I got it yesterday, I am continuously using it for 4.5 hours (approx), still 60% of battery exists. So very nice battery backup.I could not activate the vibration mode on ringing in the neckband as claimed by many. I don't know why.The sound quality is very good. Not very high bass, but the acoustic sound you'll get. The lows and highs are nicely adjusted.Thanks boult

Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.there are no concerns according to me till now .I'll update when something goes wrong.

This is my second purchase, the first one being about one and a half years ago. Glad to find out they've kept the quality of sound, excellent noise cancellation and deep punchy bass in this revised product.Listing out some of my observations between the two :*The older version had a vibration motor, newer model doesn't because of certain issues related to health they say. I personally loved the vibration feature though but I appreciate the company being a little health conscious too.*The cables connecting the speakers in the older model were made of some wrinkle free flexible rubber like material which seemed very soft but delicateThe newer model seems to have stronger cables but it does wrinkle. I hope the coating won't wear off like the older one.*Acoustics feels almost no difference.. Still the best I've used in this price segment so far.Hard to mention the details as I've just got the product last night!I'll need some time to dwell into the details and will let you all know if I've found anything good or bad..Based on my previous experience the only problem with this product was the delicate cable and the speaker cap getting off because of improper functioning of the glue maybe. Hope I won't find those in this one.

Did not receive the product in brand new condition. I am very disappointed that Amazon sent me a product in same condition even for the second time after returning the first one. The product is super hyped and is not worth buying. Build quality is average. Not comfortable for long duration usage use you will get ear pain soon. Adjustable ear buds of different sizes are not provided. It gets automatically disconnected if the earphones are not active for few minutes. You will have to go through pairing the device again. Does not get paired easily you have to turn off and on the headset again to connect. Battery backup is also not up to the mark as advertised. Overall not worth buying.

I Have purchased this Hand-free after seeing reviews on Amazon, Internet and YouTube... Sound Quality is Good but not best. Bass quality is also good but again not that much good maybe due to bad quality Ear Buds. It's not a soft rubber which you find on other headsets which fits well in ear. This headset earbud material is not good at all. I need to adjust them every time I wear them. Dont understand why Boult company didn't used soft rubber ear buds tips... It's light weight and compact.

I was looking for a good headset and came across it after reading lot of reviews.What I likedGood sound Quality.Very Sturdy and flexible band.Doesn't feel sticky on neck. In fact I wore it whole day by mistake and came to know in the evening that the band was on my neckalthough it says 10 hours of battery backup, but you can get upto 8 hours, may be it depends on type of usage.Light weight.The issue I am facing is if I am on a call some times voice breaks. So need to put mobile on hand while on call.But awesome sound quality when it is connected to TV.

The boult's curve headset became a favorite due to the wireless and handsfree use, using the bluetooth headset, its audio is quite clear, and prevents any external sound when you are listening to music or Talking on the phone, while riding the bike without using the phone, I can call anyone with the help of Google Assistance, pick up the call, and listen to the podcast or music of my choice, its battery backup too. Good, but recently after its warranty expired, I found that the voice from the right earbud of this headset has stopped, I mailed to the company. But the answer came that your warranty is over, then I have done nothing, I hear from the left side now, but do not experience as before, but I am happy that I got a very good experience for one year at such a low price, for that Thank you Boult.

The product failed and is unable to get charged just after 6 months. The range of the blue tooth and the ability to pair smoothly and connect is disappointing in quite a few devices. This is apparently a poor quality and mediocre product. Boult customer care has contacted me today.

DO NOT BUY!! Within three months of purchase, the earphones aren't charging. It is totally dead. I contacted the customer service for it, and absolutely no reply from them. Not even an acknowledgement of the email. A person called to ask me to leave a review here, I told him about the issue too. Still no response.

Firstly, I am amazed and surprised for the unexpected delivery within 12 Hrs. Kudos! To Amazon team for surprising me. I ordered this product yesterday after getting positive feedback from one of the user. Initially, I thought he is over praising the product; however, I went ahead and order for myself yesterday evening around 8.30 pm and unexpectedly the product was delivered today morning around 8.30 am.I found the product good with this price range. Product came with smart packing and with accessories as told in product description. Look wise product is exceptionally good. Dual color combination of black and grey is very attractive. Material as well is soothing to touch, feel and look.Product very easily connected via Bluetooth with device. Sound quality is good as expected. Vibration feature on neck band is a great tool which ensure we miss no call or message even if the phone is put on silent mode.Only aspect where I feel disappointed is the noise cancel. Otherwise the product is good.

Paisa Vasool Bluetooth Earphone. Base is toooo Amazing. Im using seen last to days without charge. Battery life too long. Only one problem i face which is connectivity . when you go Far more then 10 meter is blinking means is slowly slowly reduced the sound and than disconnected. Also when we moving on bike with speed more the 60-70 its slightly lagging in sound. need improvement in this two part. Overall Awesome Bluetooth Earphone with vibration Alerts Feature.

I bought my boult after a lot of research - looked at boat, noise-shot and what not. A friend of mine suggested this and she had purchased about 4-5 for multiple family members.. I thought she was crazy but now i know why she did that. This is by far the best investment that i have made on a piece of electronic gadget. Paid about 960 rps (offer price 999 - some offer that was a cashback to amzon pay) .. so for this throw away price, i think i made some amazing profit. The earphones works seemless with my phone and my laptop at the same time (multiple connections is possible). Of course, if you move away from one of these devices, it keeps beeping, which kinda interrupts the audio flow on the connected device. Solution is to disconnect and reconnect. Works similarly when you have to connect to both devices (phone and laptop) at the same time, Disconnect and reconnect. The bass quality, clarity in pitch, mic voice reception and everything is perfect.. I am in love with my earphones. Thanks BOULT !!

Noise cancellation is good. I have one boat and one Noise wireless headphone I think Noise has better bass but Boult is good. Saw this ad by Kriti Sanon it's at a reasonable price range

got the product two times, original n replacement.Luckily I've get to know the issues in few days.It's ok for 899/- but normal price like 1199/-  * mic is not working properly,  Diallers unable to talk with me for long,  they keep complaining that my voice not  audible to them  *  When I get the second productin  replacement, I felt the control was like  cheap Chinese toy along with above problemFinally I thank that they accept refund atleast.

While it works well just for listening, the microphone is absolutely useless. The person on the other side of the phone could barely hear me. I did a mic test n it failed miserably. And the worse part that I cant even return it. Only replacement is possible, for which I have placed an order. I hope it's just a defect with the piece n the next one is better else it'll be a waste of money.. Really regretting buying this..

this is value for money product. The build quality is good, neckband is flexible and light weight.sound quality is good.Battery life is good, it gives 8 hours of audio playback time. Bass quality good but not heavy.Only problem i faced when i open the boult website for registration, i could not find the ""Probass curve"" option.

So I ordered yesterday and got it delivered today. Amazon stuck to its commitment. So here's  a thumbs a up to them. 👍Regarding the product1. Pairing is easy and smoothly done. Sound quality phenomenal. And so far call quality is also great. Battery back up - have used so far 4-5hrs and that consumed some 20% battery. So should be able to give the 15hrs it promises.3. Build of the product is impressive. Buds comfortable.I shall update after a month's usage.

Received this neckband and it was working properly. after one months usage one ear phone is not working and I send as per the customer care suggestions. After 10 days came back another one, but it was not working, even cant switch on. Again I send back to them and after 10 days it came back. Now its working but vibration not working.  I Purchased it from Amazon for Rs. 1399/. and spent (150+150) 300 for sending back  it for replacements and still not working properly.  It means they are not testing the same before sending back to the customer. I dont know how many times I have to send back to them again. Till now I spent 1699 and who knows how many times I have to send it again again. My suggestion: Dont Buy!

The headphone has a good battery life and it is very comfortable to wear.The noise cancellation is also good.The sound quality of the headphone is good but it is impossible to use this headphone outside home or while walking or doing any other work.It has a very poor network range. The connection keeps breaking even if you are walking slowly. As soon as you come out of home, the headphone starts vibrating indicating poor connectivity.You can't talk to someone on phone using this headphone outdoors. Even listening to music is impossible.I don't know how come it has been labeled fit for workouts.For the sound quality, it can be rated 4. But for connectivity I won't even give it one star, it is so pathetic in that area.
"

If you are a music lover, this is the neckband for you.In terms of calling and noice cancellation it doesn't perform like the old Pro bass curve.Bass is bit high,The caller on the other side is listening you louder than your actual sound.Some issues comes when it touches 60%Like it starts to reboot itself and that really bothersAnd bellow 40% sometimes it stops working on calls, so you have to reboot your mobile to connect back.But Battery performance is so good, it'll take a good time to reach 60%. If you are a gamer, then this is not for you.Latency is very high.For musicVideosYouTube videosVideo callsWatching amazon prime/Netflix etcIt's amazing.

Over all a good product at a price range of 899.Decent sound quality.Vocal is clear.Good for calling, mic quality is good.Not recommend as a bass headset. Normal bass.My old 350/- wired headset had much better bass than this.Bluetooth range is poor. If you keep your phone on your pocket, then its fine.Any separation like a wall will disconnect your device easily.Battery life is average. Will update after one month.

This has been one of my best purchases. I must say these are amazing bluetooth earphones.The built is amazing. The best part of its built is that it is light in weight and very flexible.The earplugs are amazingly comfortable. While listening you almost forget that you have something plugged into your ears. The fittings is simply fantastic making it ideal for sports and travels.The look and feel is great. It looks really stylish. Whether you have it rested on your chest or listening, wearing this makes you look really smart.The sound quality is terrific. The bass is punchy and has got a fantastic balance with the treble. The highs are truly beautiful.The connectivity is superb. I have tried it in windy areas doing outdoor activities.The battery life too is sufficient for an avid music listener like me.I would strongly recommend this product.

Straight to the point.Pros1. Admirable sound quality. 4/52. Superior quality mic for calls. 4.5/53. Good battery life. Works 4-6 hours on a single charge. 4/54. Comfortable in ears and great build quality. 4.5/55. Connects instantly soon as you turn on the device. 4.5/5Cons1. Really poor bluetooth connection. A simple curtain comes between phone and the earphones and you can begin to hear strong crackles. 1/52. Control buttons(Volume up/down/pause) feel a little clumsy. Could've been more ergonomical. 3/5

My earphone stopped working after 6 months from the day i bought it. When i complaint for it to customer care (since it is still under warranty), initially they try to deny me by saying register your complaint through this and that, then finally they ask me courier it to them, after 10 days of pushing them i got it back and what i found was that my piece was replaced and this one is still not working. When i again complained to them they said again file a complain and again send to us. This is like a joke to them that i keep spending money in couriering them and keep receiving defective items. really not happy with the product and top of that the kind of service provided by them. When i had to buy the product that time it arrived to me for free and now for repairing it i have to keep paying for it.

I was looking for this wireless since last one month, finally I got it from amazon with Rs 50 cashback.My friends were telling me to buy Boat wireless earphone as this is not so worthy but my friends I am telling you it has sexy lookcomfortable fit to ears,Top class build qualityCrystal clear sound qualityGood bass, not best but not disappointing.Awesome battery backup, I am usually once in a three days. I keeps it connected for whole day and up to sleeping time for listening music youtube for sometimes, facebook. You can normally use it 9-10 hrs nonstop or can be more than this.

I had given 4-star rating but changing it to 1 as I can't opt for zero. Writing review after 20 days susage.The headphone stopped working suddenly. It was worked absolutely fine for a few days. I can hear white noise and nothing works. I swear will never buy Boult product henceforth.
"

This earphone is good obviously. But don't expect too much from it. Built quality is good enough at this price. Battery backup is really impressive. But when it comes to sound quality, you may get disappointed. If you like only Bass, then go for it. There is almost zero Treble. No balance between Bass and Treble. So You will miss that crispy clear sound. You have to manage it to some extend, with extra equalizer installed in your device. Overall experience is not bad. Deserves 4 star.

Pros: Nice Sound QualityBluetooth connectivity is goodBassLight weight hence you do not recognize.Cons: It may not be for some, but this earphone can be connected to two devices simultaneously but sometimes it has problems to switch between them or to connect. My requirement was to connect to phone and laptop simultaneously but sometimes it gives problem hence I have to disconnect one of them.

I am writing this review after 7 days of usage. This bluetooth ear phone is really wonderful. I have purchased it for 900/- INR during Amazon Sale Day. It is completely handsfree and able to attend the calls conveniently.One good benefit is if you are facing any mobile network issue in your house.Just place your mobile near window or where ever you receive good signal strength and rest mobile communicates with your earphone via bluetooth. You can attend the call from any nearest room in your house without call distortion [but only up to certain meters]Design --> ExcellentBuilt Quality --> ExcellentCall Quality via bluetooth --> Good [Very negligible distortion but not always]Ear buds --> easy to fasten in the ear without any discomfort.Music & Songs via Bluetooth --> Excellent bass quality with noise cancellationFM radio --> plugin any other wired earphone jack to your mobile and hear the song in boult earphone via bluetooth. Not very much pleasing. You will hear lot of distraction while listening songs from FM radio.Battery life --> Excellent. I have tested it continuously only for 8 hours and it works perfectly.GPS Navigation --> Very helpful. You can listen to google maps navigation voice especially while riding two wheeler.Earphone Vibration --> Excellent. It vibrates when you receive the callsBelow Accessories comes along with Pack:-> spare ear buds> USB cable for chargingThat's it. I will rate it 4 out of 5.

Headset is very nice. Once configured, it autoconnects from the next time. Shows battery level in mobile phone. Good battery life. I use it regularly for my 'work from home online' sessions and have noticed couple of times after continuous 2 hours of work, remaining battery percentage stands at 90%.Pros:1. Adjustable length of wire2. Magnets holding budside together3. Good battery life4. Elegant and fit design for neck5. Easy connection6. Buds fit well in the ear7. Nice noise cancellationCons:1. Music cannot be played using buttons in the neckband2. Bass is not 'awesome' I think. But okay.Overall, an awesome product

It feels comfortable. I wear helmet while riding and it never hurt my ear.At times, there are some connectivity issues (don't know if its phone's fault).Sound is very good. Good noise cancelation.I use it mostly to hear audio books while driving & take calls while I'm in office. At times, i hear music too. Its really good. I got it for 999 plus 150rs cashback during prime day. At 850rs, i really don't have any complaints. Awesome headphone.

After using this product for 2 days continuously outdoor and indoor , here is the revuew of this product:Build quality of neck band: great 4 out of 5Build quality of button: 2 out of 5 , you will feel its little loose and in future it won't even work that's what I feel.Charging: less than 2 hours and it is fully chargedBattery: There is definitely a problem with battery life. From 100% to 40% it works fine but when you reached 40% and you turn off the earphone, it will be fully discharged. You have to charge it again.Price: 999/- great for this earphone but still If you can spend 999 Rs then why not adding some 200- 500 bucks and buy other great quality product.Packaging: awesomeBattery indicator: men it's not really visible from 1-2 meter distance.Vibration: I did not get any vibration on this earphone.With this much review I returned the product so can buy new one.

Bass is pretty decent. It punches in ear at higher volume. Not for pure music lovers this is only for who looking for budget wireless bluetooth.The major problem in this Bluetooth is poor connectivity. In its description written Bluetooth range is 10m(30ft) but literally its range is 2&2.5m.I'm really disappointed with boult. Is this problem is fixes by you or not plz tell me.I order this product in the reference of boult loop wired earphone because i think will be a good product and wireless will be satisfied me but it's not.Sorry boult....One thing can you fix this problem?

Ordered BOULT Probass Curvepro with some hesitation after reading some negative reviews. But after using it continuously for a day & after verifying each doubt read in the review; I must admit that, it’s a monster in terms of sound, bass and noise cancellation. I have given 4 stars and deducted on star for the built quality and vibration quality. It would have been somewhat better. Overall built quality is good but could be more better. As always Amazon kept its promise and delivered product on time.Very much satisfied with the product. Thank you boult & kudos to engineering team for designing such a beautiful aesthetic sound monster.👍🏼👍🏼

Ordered this on 5 May 2019 for 1000 rupees!  I would say this has been a good choice until now (1 month) - the noise cancellation is good - the overall body of the earphones is also solid. I wear it the whole day and have not seen sweat stains or effects on it.Please note the earplugs are rubber - so if your ear is sensitive to it, would advise against this product. Else this is good for the value being paid

The Sound quality and noise cancellation is great.. design is also great..fit in ear perfectly but there is a measure issue about its mic...when I recieve a call I can hear incoming voice so clearly but my voice not pass to another end..I tried to speak loudly but it's mic is not working properly...so always I need to disconnect my phone from headphones...for calling function these headphones are USELESS..very disappointed

Overall experience till far is fine.Product seems ok to me. Not so facinating or out of the box.Sound quality is ok, but after lostening to hours, you will not be able recognise good bass quality.Mic has good noise cancellation but sometimes voice is inaudible to other person if mic position is not so close.Battery life is good.I purchased this boult curve instead of boat rocker 255, just because it has vibration alert.But unfortunately am unable to feel that vibration yet. I am not able to figure this out, what part of this product vibrate while you receive an incoming call, whether its whole band or just earpplugs! Coz i haven't felt any vibration yet.I got my product replaced as well thinking that previous one could be faulty, but same problem in the new one as well. If someone figures this out, please let me know.So i'll just give 3stars to this product with my overall experience.

Have been using it for 6 months... useful....range could have been better...it needs to be in the visible zone...sound quality is balanced...not too bassy or shreiky....ear plugs do itch and replacing them with other ear tips provided is almost impossible...battery life ...3-4 hours at 50 percent volume....charges in 30 mins...could have been more  comfortable...value for money....

Its a very cheap quality headphone, Absolutely zero base, and if u increase the volume to max hoping to hear some thumping base, the only thing thumping would be your ear drums, its loud but that loudness doesnt mean its clear, it crackles at loud or near full volume, Zero Base, The wired headphones worth 50 or wireless worth 200 bucks sold on the street are still compared to this. Absolutely avoid. I returned mine after just 3 hours of usage.

1st piece i got was working good in terms of audio but battery drain was too much then i had a replacement which was only saying power on and power off then i asked for a refund.Then i ordered another one which isn't working while I'm on a call.But for gaming this is a good one i tried ordering the same piece so many times cause i thought maybe I'll get a properly functioning piece but every piece had a problem gonna ask for another replacement if it doesn't work then I'll just go with refund and buy from FLIPKART to make sure i at least get a functioning product i can trust

Am writing this after using for 30 days I have used other neckbands in this price range, which have similar sound quality but what I like in this is the design, which looks modern and not too awkward.What I don't like in this is three things:Bluetooth connection stability - Ok ,if you used beyond the parameters then  it will disconnect.Very annoying vibration feature - the neckband rattles whenever a call comes, making you regret buying this, they shouldn't have bothered with that vibration feature, it's ridiculous, the build quality of the switches is not that good, feels very cheap, looks okay but feels cheap.Power saving feature - there are other neckbands which you connect and leave, if the connection is lost and later you come close to the neckband it will get connected again immediately, but this one gets switched off automatically if the connection is off, and the connection can go off very easily in this, so you have to keep switching on and connecting this back. Zoook neckband you can connect and leave phone charging or something and walk around freely without any problem, with this one you connect and stay within 2-3 mts from the phone.Overall I'd say good to go

1. Sound quality is good , vocals are clear and bass is enough to sway you.2. Battery backup is also too good , it takes hardly 1h 30 min to get completely charged and provides battery backup for 10-15 hours , which i feel is very good in this segment.3. Noise cancellation is pretty.The only reason i gave it four stars is it's not made for gaming. Too high latency and it will never give u a good gaming experience.Apart from gaming, its a very good choice at this price. Go for it, u won't regret 😊

Pros: only 1 which is its sound quality while listening if you are not a bass lover and like clear sound.Mic quality was good.Cons:Build quality doesn't looks premium feels like 500-600 rs product, even leaf, boat products have better build quality.Sound in earphones when other person is speaking is less compared to listening from handset.I returned the product as i purchased for a long term use and didn't felt this as a durable one.The product package which i received wasn't proper condition and half broken box i received. Even the company packaging was also bad from boult.

First let us look at the aesthetics. Excellent and sturdy packaging, comes with user manual and license agreement. The finish of the headphone is very good with the controls easy to navigate, while over the ear. The swivel is very smooth and provides fluid rotation. Each earphone speakers turn to about 120 degrees for flat configuration - easier portability. The ear cushion is thick and does not hurt the ears. The headband also has cushions and can be adjusted for tight fit. Again extending of the headband is smooth with smaller stops for accuracy.Sound quality is just great. You will have to hear it to understand the audible frequencies the headphone can deliver.

sound and device connectivity is good. Product claims fast charging, but it took more than 1 hour 15 mins for a full charge and bluetooth coverage is very poor. within 3-4 feet also audio is breaking. so this is not reliable to use daily. requesting for a return or replace with genuine one

The earphones started to act weird after 3 months of usage. I used to hear a sound like waves in my ears (one word in one ear and another in the other when I was talking to someone or listening to some music). After this, the sound got restricted to the left ear. Product not up to the expectation. Claiming a warranty also is a headache on its own.I have sent the product to the service center about 1.5 months ago. I am getting a single reply from their side to wait for 3 days and the product will be dispatched. Worst ever service. Do not buy it. If already bought, then don't go for a warranty claim as it will never happen. If there was an option to give a negative rating I'd have given it as I am living with no earphone since I have sent it for warranty claim.

The headset is really good in sound and bass and noise cancellation as well. It gives me round about three days of battery life in single charge what more I could have expected. I just love the new headset. Now comes the bitter part. One of the earphones back panel just came off. The glue with which it is pressed just went off exposing the speakers. Tried to put it back but all in vain.

Boult was a new brand for me and I was skeptical before I bought it. But I'm very much satisfied with the Neck Band now.Pros:- Audio Quality- Bluetooth ConnectivityDoesn't disconnect as mentioned in some other reviews I read before buying the product- Battery LifeA minimum of 8 hours easy in use, can last almost a day when not in use- Fast Chargingclose to 2 hours of charging, got a power cord and also an additional incentive- Good Quality Neck PieceI sometimes sleep wearing the neck band and remove it in the morning like nothing happened. No pain, no irritation- Ear BudsMultiple sizes earbuds were provided- Good Noise Cancellation- Good Mic for calls as well as recording. The Mic Picks up our sounds good even when there's a lot of noise in the roomCons:- Length of power cord is very smallManageable. But comfortable if a little bit longer- Volume Button placements is invertedI'm used to the system where Volume Increase is placed on Top and Volume Decrease is placed in the bottom. Maybe this inverted system is new based on the usage but it takes time to get used to it and sometimes I accidentally increase the volume to Max because the + is in the bottom

Worked fine for 11 days, and now it will not power on. It seems to still take a charge, but the power button will not turn unit on. It is also true what other reviewers said about the call quality. People I spoke to said my voice sounded hollow, like speaking through a can. I had good call quality with the Mulo Soundloop 500,but the cover for the charger broke off after a week, so it is no longer waterproof. This Boult has the same cover, so I would expect that it would happen to this unit as well. Unfortunately, since the Boult now will not even turn on, I will never know.

Got delivered on August 20,2020 in a good price range just 999rs.Sound quality is awesome,noise cancellation is ok but not impressed with bass because there is not any bass in these headphones,build of headphones is good and u will not feel anything on the neck because they are very light weight thumbs up for that .colour of the headphones could have been much better like Matt finish in it,controls are easy to operate but inbuilt buttons feel shaky and not of premium built ,fitting of earcords could have been much better(it may come out of ear when doing running or any frequent movements) like in probass buster or boat basshead 255 pro it's my first day of use so battery checkup needs time will let u all know after few days.P.S.~ don't buy these if u are searching for bass maybe opt for probass buster or boat 255 pro or jblThanks

The packing is perfectly sealed.Box contents Boult audio earphones, USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra earbuds.The earphone looks very good and light weight. The neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable.The buttons are on the right side. You can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.The capacity of the battery has 12 hours of playback.Battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time.Sound quality in these earphones are amazing. Call quality is really good and the bass is also amazing.The volume level on these earphones are really high.If you're looking for earphone within Rs. 1,500/- it will be the best option. Just value for money. Just give it a try I can assure you that you will not regret.

I am using this product for a week now but the drawback of this product is that bluetooth range is not even 15 feet forget about 10 meters..its good as long as your fone is with you or a vicinity of 3 to 4 meters..also it mentions in the product info that it comes with a travel pouch...but i didnt get any pouch..why lie when you arwnt including something..though the product is good but planning to return it..already packed..this is cheating, not coz i need the travel pouch but when your body is stable..it works fine but when you jog or cycle the the voice distorts..fake claims that it has some Qualcomm chip in it..dont believe it..found Samsung level U better for almost same price..

Bass quality is really below average. Overall sound quality is okay but not something to be happy about. After comparing it with Blaupunkt BE50 (costs extactly the same) the sound quality is really poor.Guys buy Blaupunkt BE50 and don’t even look at Boult. And BE50 has better battery life too.Note - have been testing both the neckbands on same iPhone.

I bought this product basically for making and receiving phone calls, it worked just below average in the beginning and everybody told me that my voice was not at all clear (very muffled) on the phone when. So I stopped using it for calls and instead only started using it for listening to audio books or YouTube videos etc. I hv no complaints abt the sound quality but it connects and disconnects frequently on its own and the Bluetooth connection re-establishes after a few seconds; This is very disturbing. I believe it is either a defective piece or this product is poor performance in general. Pls change this, as it is still in warranty!

If the product is damaged within 1 or 2 months, then it will take more than a month to get the new or repaired earphone from the manufacturer. You have to courier it to Delhi. After 2 months of buying this product, one side of earphone wasn't working properly. I requested for return, they repaired it and gave me the same earphone and it took more than a month. If the product is damaged withinWhile sending my earphone for return/replacement I also sent the charger, but charger is not yet returned to me even after more than a month again. So again I had to email them separately for the charger. Earphone is good but not worth for its price and most importantly the service is not at all good. Return/replacement may take months which is not appropriate.

When I had received this headphone I was very happy with the colour and designs and with  the fitting also,they give you one year warranty also.However this headphone stoped working after a month only I complained abt this sent them few mails also bt again and again they asked me for invoice.where as I sent them whatever they needed eventually nothing happened bcz they expect it to work for a year how come it is nt working in a months time,so what if they give u a warranty card with it.pathetic product

The sound quality is good. But the issue is with battery. As soon as the battery drops below 50%, it takes only just 15 mins to drain the entire 50% left. It is mentioned on the brand box that it gives around 8 hours if fully charged. But it is totally misleading. It provides around 3-4 hours of continuous talktime as I have used or exerienced till now. And I could not experience any noice cancellation. I bought this especially for calling purpose, and in a noisy surrounding, the mic catches the background noices more.

Using this from 2 years-Used for Music,Movies,Gaming(Valorant,pubgm,COD,wow).My thoughts from the usage of 2 years.(I bought this for 899 during sale).QUALITY:Using from 2 years,it's working well.No issues.SOUND QUALITY:Sound quality is pretty good.Not excellent but at the same time not bad.I've listened to a couple of earphones,these are pretty good compared to them.COMFORT:I've used these for a stretch of 5-7 hours many a times,but I haven't felt any issues.These aren't for GYM PURPOSE.They get off from your ear,which feels disgusting.But for normal usage these are pretty good.BLUETOOTH:There haven't been any issues with the connectivity.But recently, some times these are disconnecting without any reason.But remember that I've been using this for >2 years and facing problem after 2 years.MICROPHONE:Microphone is working really well.I could say not great but Good.I haven't faced any problem till now.I have taken number of calls till now,but nobody complained me about it.GAMING:If you play games just for fun as I do,these work pretty well.I've played Valorant,pubg-m,COD,Far Cry franchise,Tomb Raider Franchise any some more using this but I haven't faced any problem.Some times I faced SOUND LAG,for about 5-6 seconds but it's ok.But remember that I only play for fun and I am not a Hardcore gamer.BATTERY:once we charge it fully,we can use it for 8 hrs(approx.) At full voulme.Finally what I say is This one works pretty well for the price you spend on this.

The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.it includes Boult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).The earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.there are no concerns according to me till now .

They are very good earphones, light and comfortable and aesthetically designed without excesses. Most important the sound quality is very good however I would have personally desired a bit more punch in the bass not that it is lacking. I would also have liked even more control with the buttons. But overall, a great pair of earphones.

Just bought it. Things I dislike:1. The wire connecting the earphone to the neckband is thin and flimsy. I do not expect it to last 1 year. Not sure whether I can use the 1 year warranty for that. I wear this in such a way that the thin wire starts from the back of the neck to my ear. I believe that's how most people wear it if you do not want to have dangling wires, and that orientation needs this thin wire to have a 60 degree bend like a 'V' at the back of the neck. The build qulity and design is sub-par.2. Speaking of design, the 'R' symbol (to indicate right-hand side) is upside down3. Have to keep the PC volume or mobile volume high for the sound to be comfortably audible. In other earphones the PC volume is at 30% and I'm good. For this one, the volume has to be at 80%.Otherwise it is fine. But nobody is going to buy it at it's unslashed price of 4.5k lol. One has to think hard to even buy it for 1000/-. If it lasts one year, I'd feel okay. If it lasts beyond that, then I'll be surprised, and happy.

These are the best earphones in this range... This comes with a nice and safe packaging... The sound qaulty is also really awesome... The earphones are really lightweight and comfortable... I use it for many hours continuously and my ears don't feel any pain or irritation... Bluetooth connectivity is also very good... It connects easily and the range is also superb... The bass is also good... The mic also does its job greatly... The battery is also nice with 12hrs of battery backup... I have been using these  2 months and i have not faced any issues... These are working absolutely fine... I would recommend everyone to just go ahead with it without thinking twice... These are worth every penny!

I am an intensive Earphone user, I used Earphone for almost every aspect Call, Gaming and Music.So I will cover all the aspect of this Earphone.1. Call Quality:- It is Average, not good and the overall range of Bluetooth is not good. Sometimes it gets disconnect even phone is in the pocket.2. Gaming :- There is a delay and I mean a huge delay in Gaming. You will get died in PUBG and they you will hear a Gunshots. So big disappointment if you want to play a game with Headphones on3. Music :- Even though I am not an audiophile but I take my Music seriously and its very average on this earphone. Vocals are clear and loud but bass is almost zero. But if you are watching a movie or Netflix series without Music then this is best as the voice is so clear and loud. But for a bass lover a big no.The build quality looks and feels premium but actually, it is not.

The product is just Ok. Nothing like what the way it's described.There is no extra bass and HD quality stuff. It's good for calling purpose but not for those who would want some good audio quality for music.There is a very slight lag also when u are playing games on the mobile or watching video.All in all, I will not say it's bad either but Yes, It's just about OK for this 💰.  One should not expect much in this price.

Boult Audio Curve does have all the features that it was described to consist of. The sound quality is great. An option for the bud size helped me choose the most comfortable ones. Its water-proof nature makes it a great workout companion. It connects to both my devices so I can switch between devices without having to disconnect the earphones from either either. Also it is great that it switches off when not in use for a period of time.The only feature I feel could be worked upon is the constant ""connected"" indicator as it sometimes scares me amidst a quiet moment. A possible modification could be the LED on the inner side of the neckband indicating the constant state of the device instead of the sound.

Its a great buy, these are good quality earphones.Buttons provided on neckband do various functions, microphone is great too.Music quality is loud and clear with really good bass effect.Just faced issues with the Bluetooth connectivity in between, even a jerk while walking or running will disconnect the music that is being played.Else they are of great quality for music lovers.

Sound Quality is average, i wouldn't recommend anyone. One side of ear plug has lose connection. So i requested for replacement of product as it couldn't be returned. The package i had received was seal broken, before i could return, the delivery boy went away.After the receipt of replacement product, the seal seamed to be proper but than after opening the package, charger cable was missing, anyway i could recharge with my phone charger also.Sound quality after replacement seem to be good but the question is that seller or the person involved right from packaging to delivery there is suspicious of duplicate products being delivered and accessories removed too, this is why 1 star rating.

But when you play it on mobile music player or on youtube that time sound is like ok and basic equalizers are not working on bluetooth.. Then i install equalizer for bluetooth from play store.. And then it became a superbbbbbb... I got that bass feel.4) yaah there is some distrubance in connectivity while moving or riding bike. But at the same place.. Its all good5) Voice lag in only while playing pubg..6) Connectivity is so simple.. Not need to connect manually all time7) I got delivery within a 22 hours. And that was bestest.So go for it..

At this you will not get this type of bluetooth earphones because if you go for boat, no doubt that you will get good qualit of sond and bass but price would be around 3000 something and if you found any boat product in this price range you will not get long battery life.. i know boat says that there earphones will deliver you around 8 hrs but that not true it will give you around 5-6 hrs only.. so if you want a good quality product with good sound and descent bass and long battery life go for boult i am writing this review after 1 week. I use this product for one week and what i found is... sound quality is good.. bass is decent but not bad... battery life is just awesome it take 1hours and 45 min. Of charge and it goes for around 10 hours which is massive i can't use its full batter in one day.. product is confortable to use and it do have vibration.. like if you are driving and you didn't plug in this earphone inside your ears, it will vibrate and let you know that you are getting call so that you can't miss that call... great product to invest in.

Third class company. I purchased the bluetooth on 11th August 2020 but within 3 weeks it has stopped working so I raised a complaint and they ask to send that bluetooth to their address so I couriered it with bill, data cable airbuds and box but after two weeks they had returned the same product after repairing in a sweet like box wrapped in polythene and that is without box, bill, data cable and ear buds. This is an another way of cheating cos again if it stopped working so I won't be able to sent them back as I don't have bill and box. What could be more worst then that? I would suggest to people that please don't buy any product from Boult rather purchase a local one that will work long and if by any chance it won't work so you will not regret cos you haven't spend much money on that as we spent here with such so called fraud company. This is very shameful that no body is replying to my complaint. I have raised the complainant 3 times to Boult and also mentioned my comments here but didn't received any response either from both of you. I will not purchase any item from here now. Thums down 👎

After work from home began due to COVID19, I used office headset or wired earphones. Both did not allow me the luxury to move around freely to stretch myself during meetings/calls. So, I was looking for a good wireless earphone when I found this. The reviews and features were excellent for the cost at which it was available.1) Sound quality is decent2) Noise cancellation feature is pretty good as well3) Bass is good4) Sometimes during the call quality goes bad due to bluetooth connectivity issues. Voice starts to break and it continues to remain so. You will have to cancel the call and re-join to get it rectifiedOverall I would say the product is decent with improvement in connectivity issues.

This is very bad to say that this is the second time I claimed for Warranty with 4 months period of time.. Two times I faced the same problem i.e. not getting charged and not getting Switch ON/OFF .. and some times it automatically disconnected from Bluetooth...These problems have to be rectified immediately...This is the second review that I am giving again.. today (ie. 16-10-2020) only I have received this product after getting repaired by the company for 2nd time.. It is not getting connected to Bluetooth.. then what is the use of sending this to the repair unit.. Do not they check whether it is working or not before sending to the customer.. When I get the problem for the first time I spent Rs.350/- , second time Rs.150/- for courier charges..Again I have to spend money to send this for third time...

I review after using almost 1 and half month the product is good at this price.its Sounds quality is good at this price as compare to other Brands ,so I give it 5/5.Bass quality is also good but not high when I listen High Bass song it feels good , so for Bass 4/5.Battery backup maybe 6 to 8 hours on continues using.Connectivity is Very impressive mainly it take only 4 to 5 second. TLet's talk about  it's neck band After using month neck band started loosing, that is the only con'sCompany need to work on this.Overall the product is value for money and your investment on this product is not waste.Customer service is very good I register warranty just for checking there customer service I get call from them that is good thing for customer.If someone wanna to buy this product I recommend you to compare this product with other products on the bases of price. If you find other product with same price with same features and 1 year warranty from date of purchase, choice is yours which product you buy.

The box doesn't look premium but rather very cheap. The box does not contain an user manual. The product doesn't look new, which is really disappointing. I got this on early sale as an prime customer. Had to spend rs. 999 whereas after the sale started the price dropped to rs.899. the noise cancellation is not that good. The Bluetooth range is 10-15 feet without wall, not at all what it claims.Apart from that the sound quality is good. The product is light weight and comfortable. I guess the early batches of the same product which was priced at rs.1499 or rs.1399 was of better version. The newer batches doesn't have the same quality. That is the reason this is available within rs.1000.

This is a 4 days usage review.*Coming from a wired headphones that's why I felt the bass was a little lacking but not absent. It is still good.* The call clarity is really good. No issues with that.* Audio quality is good too. All voices in songs are very clear and distinct. No distortion or anything sort of yet.* Built quality is good.* The thing which I loved the most about this product is the passive noise cancellation. It is really very good. Completely felt isolated from surrounding noise.* The only thing which I disliked is the Bluetooth range. It is not very great. And my only reason for giving it a 4 star.Although I might increase the rating after a few months if I find the battery life as good as it is now.*The battery life is great. Delivers what it promises in the specifications.

Worth the buy, light weight, bass is really good. I got it for 999 and also recommended few of my friends who also bot it and they also really like it.  I think this is the best wireless headphones at this price. I tried using it with multiple phones and the audio output was bad I thought there was some issue with the headphones but later found that the audio quality from each phone varies hence it’s advisable to use a good player if you feel the quality is not that good.

It's been about a month since I have started using these earphones, Works pretty good for the money. Good battery life (7-8 Hrs), Good Bluetooth range, can't take a few turns though, Comfortable, Connects to two devices simultaneously, although, makes funny sounds wile making calls, no audio lag. The only problem I have with these is the Base, which is very important for me is not good at all, and since it's wireless I cannot chose a proper earphone in my Redmi settings. Let me know if some buddy figured out how to do it

Its a decent headset for the price range, it is wireless thats the biggest plus, the sound quality is not too great, I use an audio equalizer to get my kind of sound. But the main reason I have reduced a rating is that this headset shouts battery low every 15-20 secs when on 30% charge, I can see the charge percent on my phone, it doesn't need to remind me so many times, gets very annoying. Battery backup is also average.

These Bluetooth headsets have very poor connectivity range by deafult. Not more than 6 feet.This worked fine for some months after the purchase. I had a month left for the warranty to get lapsed so I asked for a replacement. They asked me to ship the product to Delhi which I did. The replacement product I received was a refurbished, flimsy one and it had the worst connectivity issues. The device simply won't connect or show up in the devices list.  Bad performance

Doesn't fit to my purpose. I am a tutor and looked for a headset with a good mic which can also serve as a music piece. This double purpose is not served. My old normal headset does more work with it's mic than this. I don't recommend this to teachers, while it is good for music. I am not sure whether it has return option, only replacement option is seen in amazon

Product stopped working within 3-4 months.Worst customer care/service center support.Asked to courier the original product with complete packaging and bill.After receiving they said either it will a replacement or repair for your product. But they sent me someone else's device, in a plain black box. (I can confirm as I have video of my product. Serial number, product number, batch code, everything is different.) That too without any of my original accessories, like original packaging, earbuds, usb cable, warranty card. They kept my stuff with them. And handed me used product. And since then it's been more than two months. Not a single response, either on call or email.They call me to provide 5 star review on amazon. Then I ask them for the issue. And again. They hide away.

Product was defective. I requested to return it back. But shared my quick experience.Received replaed product.1. Base/ Bass is very low in case you are a bass lover then this is definately not the product you are looking for2. Listening song will give you a OK feeling but i believe at this price it should be better3. Quality and comfort is again a disappointed in this productWith heavy heart i am sending this product back. I found it as waste of money. Could be better if available in 500 ₹ but not a single penny more on this.

I ordered this product and returned on same day as the vibration function was not working. I got a replacement within 2 days but this time the seal of the product pack inside was already opened and the replaced headset was also having the same problem. Looks like these headsets are not gone through any quality checks for performance and many buyers don't even know that there is a VIBRATE ON INCOMING CALLS AND MESSAGES FUNCTION in this headset. They just buy for MUSIC purpose so may be they are not bothered. But this function definitely adds value to the headset and if its not working, I prefer buying a wired earphone. SELLER : APPARIO RETAILS PVT LTD.PS: Kindly Check the Seller's name while ordering the products. Seems few Sellers are just rotating the products, and our wasting our valuable time.

I see lot of people complaining about getting a faulty hardware. Those review s do not contribute for the devices actual quality. You can always get a hardware replacement in those cases. My point here is regarding on the product itself. Everything looks ok. But it's a lot of interference whhen you drive a bike and listen through this. You will disconnect and choppy sounds at times. Otherwise it is fine. So if you are one of those who bought this to use while driving a bike, this is product is a not the right option for you at least from my experience. Hopefully this will help few of the buyers.

1. The connectivity sucks. It gets disconnected everytime I turn my back towards the phone which is placed at a hand distance from the device. It's horrible2. Sound is good but it do not solve the purpose of having a Bluetooth device. NOT FOR ON THE GO PURPOSE.I preferred this over JBL felt like I have made a mistake in my desicion.Don't go on the rating of the product. Need replacement.

I like these earphones and like the sound quality. I am satisfied. The design aspect of the sliding bands that keep the wires tight on the body of the neck-band is a great idea and prevents the wires from hanging too low. Definitely recommended.
"

The sound quality is not bad when it works well. The Bluetooth connectivity is not stable and makes noise bursts in our ear occasionally. The mic is totally useless. People keep complaining that they are hearing noise and they cannot hear me.

Using it for past one year. Bought this one because of its design. The wire hanging from the front side of the neck band (design of other products) is kinda uncomfortable for me. Its neckband is so perfect and comfy around the neck. The wires are clipped along the neckband which I felt so stylish and cool. Earbuds are so fit in the ear. So, in the design part this product is unique.Talking about the performance, sound quality is perfect. Noice cancellation is above average. Bass is not deep; but of course you have to consider the price. Battery life is as promised. Got 8 hrs life initially which has come down to 6-7 hrs now (1 year old). Connectivity is easy; no issues. Connectivity range, I didn't feel as good as promised by the manufacturer. One of the main feature I liked in this one was the vibration in the band while receiving calls; but I think the current product is coming without this feature. Performance of the mic is also not bad. So choose this for style, not for supreme performance (atleast, not in this price range!)

The product is good as long as it worked. After 1 month of its purchase it start to cause troubles. Initially the power button occasionally stopped responding later the product stopped working completely. Now it is not at all switching on. I need a replacement. The fitting of the ear buds is also not comfortable as occasionally the sound quality reduces..do not buy this

It's so light weight, comfortable. Sound quality is awesome, I feels every beat of the music, base is the best thing of this product. Battery quality is also good. Over all its the best product in this price. I recommended to every music lover to buy this.

I would say very comfortable and durable product. Charge lasts upto 5hrs on single full charge. Sweat proof. Drawback is some times Bluetooth connection gets disturbed, or totally blank can be fixed by turning off the head set and going to Aeroplane mode in mobile and connecting again.Reason for 1 star : Poor customer service from Boult. Not a genuine people.

Under price of Rs. 999, this product seems quite useful,Sound quality is good,noise cancellation works ok,Bass quality seems okay,It charges within 2.25 hours with zero battery.Bluetooth connectivity works within 10-15 ft. Sometimes it breaks between range of 7 ft. Which I observe.This review is given on only 1 month usage, I'm first time using a wireless earphones, I'll update my review again after couple of months.

First thing I like about it is, it's decent sound quality, connectivity, but it's overall build quality is not so good, the wire cable has got torn after my 2 years of use, one side ear attachment got weaker. Better not to buy this product now, coz I bought it for Rs.1500 2years back, now more good products are arriving, though it has become lil cheaper but it still has some issues to deal with, otherwise to be honest, even after getting torn, the device is still workingworking nicely.

Rarely you come across a company that excels in its product and after sales service. Boult Audio is that rare find, after using for 6 months there was a sudden shut down in this head band ... and trust me I’m ruthless with it’s usage 8 hours straight daily. Since they provided me a 1 year warranty I approached the company since it was not switching on ... with 2 days they fixed the problem and returned it back. First of all it’s value of money, secondly even after being an electronics company their after sales is superb. Boult Audio is going places - the specific product I bought is quite a winner all the way.

Average product but more expensive when it comes to price as per the quality of the product. The item looks old like someone has returned it but the replacement was exactly the same. Old and dull. Further they have mentioned that it vibrates when you turn it on, but neither the replacement nor original vibrated. Unsatisfied with the item. Not so cool.

Hi folks!!This isn't a review but a small request.PLZ DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT.I bought this product for just 1000 in a deal but still I have to write this review. I have already got one replaced thinking that my product was defective. But the reality is these earphones are the worst I have seen and used so far. Just imagine you are watching a movie and the laptop is on your lap and still the Bluetooth connection fails 😡. When you are walking ,and mind you not running ,the song you are listening to will get killed several times as the Bluetooth connection fails. In furtherance to this the company says it has superb bass but I was wondering is there any bass at all...Lastly I have just one question what's a Bluetooth earphone with a totally failed Bluetooth connection....I just wanted to write this to save people from wasting their hard earned money and to open boult's eyes.Cheers!!

The packaging is average. The sound quality and clarity are very good. In orchestric music it became easier to find each instrument's tune. That shows good fidelity. Voice through mic is clear without background sounds. Yet to do the litmus test for this but am presently very happy with this product and its price(after discount of course).

No exact policy of Warranty. Disgusting and very poor quality. When Product not working I asked Manufacturer customer care , they denied to pick . They suggest to courier the product with own cost.

I spent a long time deciding whether to purchase Boat Rockerz 255 or Boult Probass Curve, but I finally decided to buy the Boult Pro Bass Curve and it turned out to be the best decision. As my main requirement was for taking calls, I paired the earphones with my mobile and called one of my friends as soon as I received the earphones, and let me tell you, the  clarity of the sound was amazing, the person on the other side could hear my voice clearly. I even  took a few calls in a bit of a noisy environment but still the other person could hear my voice clearly. So I would suggest that if anyone wants a good quality earphone for the main purpose of calling then this is the best wireless earphone you will find in this price range.

Build is good. Buttons are on left side, which is new, but doesn't cause any problems per se. Awesome battery life, lasts an entire day for me with 1 full-charge. Sound quality isn't amazing, but great nevertheless. Not pure noise-canceling, although it does filter out to some extent. The wires are housed in a narrow channel in the band, and locking straps are provided, so should last a long time without wear and tear. Dual connection works great. Overall, satisfied with my purchase.

This was the second time I was dissatisfied with the product. Infact, the second time it was pathetic. In the first time, even though I found the earphones to be good in the first hour, only after some of listening, it started aching severely in my ears. Moreover, I simultaneously tried other earphones which didn't. Moreover, a couple of days into use, these earphones started having connectivity issues. Out of nowhere, even though it showed connected, it played the media on my speakers, that's the most pathetic thing to happen. Imagine having a private business with this pair of earphones and it blasts out on the speaker out of nowhere. Moreover, the connectivity had issues, I had to power it on/off again and again to connect. Apart from this, the buttons had poor functionality and we're looking obviously cheap build.Now, the horror, my replacement issues. I agreed for replacing the product. I got the replacement. It was so bad since the moment I opened the box. The earbuds had TRACES OF EARWAX. DISGUSTING. And it also gave up evidences of a refurbished product. I tried to get over it by changing my earbuds (took me a lot of convincing). I tried, the earache persisted, however, with more problems. The connectivity was so bad, I was barely 4 metres away with a wall in between, it worked in a terrible condition. Listening to music became an absolute nightmare. Apart from that, the buttons work only after a second or third attempt and give vibes of a cheap build quality. The only good thing was the battery life, maybe because I barely used it for more than an hour. However, the rating is 2 star only for the amazon delivery personnel and customer service personnel as they were amazing. Especially naveen who I had a chat with, was of a great help.

I feel it is best earphone under 1k, while i was purchased at 899 during festival fair.. I give 3 stars for build quality, it could have been better. I'll give 5 stars for music quality seriously i liked it.. Its better than Boat and JBL.. It was worked fine for 4 months since i purchased then it is completely dead, then i trying to search service centre in chennai, but no service branch anywhere in this country only one office available in Delhi.. Then i had courier them my defective pcs, in return they provided new latest version earphone. It is much better than earlier version im so happy now, though i dont know how long it will work still its misery😁 My suggestion u can try this

Packing :The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.Box contents :Boult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).First impression :The earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.Buttons :The brick on the right side has the buttons.We get 1 multifunctional button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off.you can also attend the calls and end the calls by single pressing them.while playing music you can pause/play by single press.You can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.Connectivity :Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.Battery:The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.Additional features :These earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating. I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.Sound quality :Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.

These earphones are probably the best option in this price range. The build quality is really good and the battery life is amazing! The sound quality is above par, which is exceptional considering the price of this product. I would say the connectivity isn't always on point and the earphones aren't comfortable while wearing them for longer durations. Can't comment on the durability since it's a very recent purchase, but considering the build quality, this product should last for a long time if you are an average user.

Got this product at effective price of ₹799 (Received Amazon Pay Cashback of ₹200 when the price was ₹999 as I had purchased this on prime day).The sound quality is Good & Above Average but not that pleasing.Bass quality is good enough with above average noise cancellation.It has average Battery Life of 8+ Hours and it charges fully within 2 hours.Look of the earphone is Very Nice and Perfect.It's Lightweight and you won't feel anything on your neck.It has Connectivity Range up to 10m as description says.Magnets attach the two earphones together when not using them but they're not that strong and it looks durable if used normally.The packaging is Not Perfect however the earphones were placed securely in the box which is fine.These earphone come WITHOUT vibration and it clearly states on product name itself so read the name carefully.Also observed that the SOMETIMES the voice is continuously BREAKING (like it happens when you have network issues while on call) while you have that plugged into your ears listening to the song and I feel that is one of the most annoying thing you can experience with this earphones.

Ordered, got a defective product. Magnets were positioned wrong, so instead of sticking to each other it repelled. Mic volume is too low, the person on the other end wasn't able to hear me clearly.The buttons rattled and felt like cheap plastic.Battery life lived up to standards tho.Left earpiece was louder than the right one, but music quality was good. Comfortable to wear and connection was strong.Update 1:Replaced the headset and everything is fine now, buttons don't rattle, mic quality is much better, and the magnets were proper.Audio quality is awesome.Update 2:Battery percentage doesn't show properly, indicator shows properly till 50% then gets stuck in it for hours and gives battery low warning while still displaying at 50%.

These are good quality earphones as far as battery life is concerned but sound quality is very average. Lot of disturbance in bluetooth connection, if you bring it near smart watch or any other gadget. Its vibration function can be really irritating, and keeps vibrating like cheap gadgets with no option of disabling the same. Most important thing is that My earphones suddenly stopped working in hardly two months with practically careful usage. The same are not getting started only despite being fully charged. Getting in touch with their customer care is really difficult. All the time you will keep hearing the message that all their customer care guys are busy on the calls and system will prompt you to keep a message. You will never get a call back from them after that. Think twice before opting for these earphones.

Product is ok as for price 899 .sound is good in high volume only otherwise you can not hear properly in low volume .Battery backup is good .Feels lite weight and band is also not too good but ok . Battery backup is not good as they described ,it says low battery when Battery level is 20% and you can't use after without charging also I notice battery level drops to 20 % in short time or half an hour when it is in 50% ...and other 50% battery backup after charging come for 5-6 hours that's it . Battery backup feature as described in detail is not true and don't believe this is good product .

Downgrading rating due to poor customer support. Sent a faulty device as replacement and when complaining by email, all I get is a AWB number status update. It's like they are hiding behind auto status emails. If possible avoid. Go with bigger brands.The product quality is fine as long as it works !!!

I had a very pathetic experience with Boult . I thought to give a try with this brand  because i always used sony,boat but this brand disappointed me. I received this product and post 4 months the product stopped charging , I dropped a complaint to their customer support to replace the product and the replaced product was also defected  and when I again loggef the complaint they sent me a big form and told me to self ship the product which is truly pathetic and annoying.

I am pleasantly surprised at how much I am loving this earphone. It fits perfectly in my ears and does not fall off even once when I am doing jump rope or any other exercise.the sound quality is great and the mini woofer does make a difference. Built quality is also good and Bluetooth connects very fast to my phone or computer.

Dear Boult Audio Support Team,I have recently purchased a Bluetooth Earphone just 10 days ago, and now I have observed that the earphone is not getting charged properly. Once it has got discharged, it is not getting ON even if I'm trying to switch it on.Either there is problem in charging of the earphone, Or there is some hardware problem in switch ON / OFF button.Such kind of issues in a newly purchased product was not expected at all.Invoice of the item is being attached.Requesting for immediate action and desired support and solution as soon as possible.Please do the needful at the earliest, and you may contact me on below given contact number.Best RegardsRobin Roy

I ordered this product on October 9. The product arrived at 6:30 in the evening. From 09 Oct 6:30 to 10 0ct 6:30 evening, I used it continously without charging it. Then 90 % battery went off after the day 1. The first call got the issue of noisy and unwanted sounds but after that calls were functioning normal. Noise cancellation, I can rate at 3* and bass is not that good. No ear pain. Sound quality is OK. Overall the product is very good.
"
2773,"
The sound quality is not that great. What disappointed me is the mike. It is not so powerful and cannot be used for webinars or meetings . I was surprised that the audience gets better quality of sound from the mike of laptop than the mike of this bluetooth headphone. Also the neckband is too short and therefore not comfortable. Even the earbuds design and the overall product design is not that comfortable.
"
2774,"
Bad experience.It initially starts with a very low sound and  the opposite listener always complains.After some time it picks up.This does not allow me to use it for official meeting calls.It has good connectivity and no complaints for that.During the call it suddenly causes a very garbled noise like a weak connection may cause.The Ear phones are a bit bulky and big and hurt my ears.
"
2775,"
Calls get muted automatically sometimes. It connects to any open Bluetooth and produce beep sound continuously. Please dont get trapped by purchasing. During call, the sound is not audible due to heavy bass. It's bass effect suits only for music. So, purchase 2😂. If u bend ur neck n mic is obstructed, the mic stops receiving sound completely.Noice cancellation works well.Only one side is working.🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
"
2776,"
Mic is not good the listener keeps complaining voice is too low, need to hold mic near mouth which was not expected at all.Battery life is good, sound is good, comfortable in ears and looks good too.

So here we go...According to the price this one is the good bluetooth headphone but if we talk about sound quality so while on full volume I had to face a bit disturbing sound of base which just hitting my ear drums badly but yeah at a mid volume it has a great sound bass is not upto the mark as comparatively others but design and the quality is very good and at this price you can say its a great deal..

I am putting a honest review here after 2 months of use. Sound is good. Left side earpiece broke after only 2 months of use like any cheap earphone picked from footpath. See photo that I posted. One of the clip for adjusting wire length was loose and that irritated me. I had to put in a piece of paper to firmly hold it. The bluetooth connection sometimes gets lost for a second. Battery life is good enough for full day use. Noise cancellation is awesome and this is very lightweight. I recommend to play it in maximum 75-percent volume because its loud enough. Long use in higher volume can damage the headphone and your ear too. It would have been better if it supported alexa or google assistant.Thank you.
"
2779,"
Noise cancellation is very good. I’m able to take calls while riding on bike with no disturbance to the person on the other side of the call . Battery backup and connectivity is also good. I received multiple calls from boult seeking feedback on the product, this indicates their dedication to establish the brand.
"

Build quality is good as Physical.But Less star because of unclear sound quality. I'm a person who like each word clear, which is not in this. Calling is lit bit embarassing. But in case of Music you find lot of bass.  This is my 3 Audio product from Boult!
"
2781,"
The response time to connect with mobile phone when the Bluetooth mode is on, is a bit late or you say lagging. Also when a phone call is received, it takes 2 seconds to respond. The sound quality along with bass is fairly good. Build is good with sturdy looks also being flexible. I wouldn't recommend this for a advanced user but a good startoff for a beginner.

Have used it very frequently satisfied with the product .Overall Playtime isn't as mentioned but it's pretty Upto the mark .Fits well into the ear without any unjust can be used wearing helmet.Controller aren't of great help as It couldn't play next song .My Redmi note 7 doesn't connect even when kept in pocket .

Its my 3rd day with Boult audio curve and I am fully satisfied with the product.  It has a great customer support team to resolve your all issues regarding connectivity.It has around 12-14 hours battery backup as of now, which is far better than mi and realme products.It is a value for money product. Build qulaity is not better than Mi or realme but it comparitvely 300-400 INR cheaper also than other brands.I will recommend you all to buy this product.

Colour : Black1) best packaging from Amazon team.2)  SOUND clearity is very good and smooth.3) The neckband quality was superb.4) EARPODS are very smooth that don't hurt the ear.5) BATTERY backup upto 8-10 Hours.6)  build quality... metallic and plastic7) Value For Money8) VIBRATOR Gives attention while phone calls.

The first impression of the product is ok.But its a worst one ever i bought.Because ,I got a complaint (battery) in the first week, then i was return to seller and and he send me a new one .Then the  two months ok. Again got complaint (buttons and charging issue)Most important the coustomer service of boult audio is very bad.I contacated to the customer care 4 times they did take any action against this complaint.Imp. don't buy this product , if you buy this wireless headphone  thats don't last to 3 months i guarentee.Very bad customer service product full of complaintsWaste of moneyThanks to loose my rs.1200 boult audio

Sound quality is very good at this price segment but the loudness can be a bit overwhelming sometimes at max volume.Noise cancellation is good and you will have a hard time listening to other sounds when using the earphones.Bass is very balanced as compared to overwhelming bass of boat rockerz 225 which is a direct competitor of this earphones.For an audiophile these earphones are better than its counterparts such boat as it delivers balanced clear sounds as compared to boat rockerz 225 in which the bass is very dominant and kills off the highs of the media youre listening to.Range is good and and only drop of your phone is more than 15 meters.

I have received my Boult ProBass CurvePro yesterday and I must say it's really awesome, sound quality is absolutely fantastic, although noise cancellation is not 100%, it still does a pretty good job at this price point. Out of 5, I will give 5 stars.It's an excellent product. I was never expecting the premium quality headset at this price. Design and build quality look very good with a sporty look and feel. It's quite light in weight when you wear it, plus it's very flexible.At this price, my suggestion is to go for it!

I bought the bluetooth not 2 months back and I started facing issues in 1st week itself. In the end, to end my agony, i contacted customer care and they told me to courier it to Delhi and wait for 10 working days. I did as asked and when I received my device back, it was worse than before and when I tried to contact them, they didn't respond. ( no answers to mail until 3rd day). They said their senior will contact me and it's been two days for that. they are asking me to send it again(through mail) for repair. It's really bad and it's been a waste of money. I bought it for 1299₹ as suggested by my friend
"
2789,"
It stopped working in just 45 days. Contacted boult service Center and they asked to ship it to their Center in Delhi. I already did it and paid courier charges as well. However, still waiting to hear on this from boult service. This is waste of time and money both. I would recommend not to buy boult products as you will end up with frustration. Go with some good brands...

Writing this after using for more than three months. The material is good and comfortable. The bluetooth is not so great, it gives disturbance whenever there is something between your phone and earphones. Overall, at this price, this is good.

Bass quality could have been better,But for 999rs i cant complain much.1. Sound quality is pretty clear,well balanced, won't damage ur eardrums aftr long hours use.2.

Thanks boult...at least I got repair my product within warranty period...

As of my personal experience of using this earphones... I personally do not liked it at all. The quality of earphone is so cheap that it looks like you have worn a fake or some artificial earphones.Also, the sound quality the company have guaranteed in their advertisement is totally opposite. I mean the quality is also poor with no bass at all. Battery life is also poor.... you can hardly use it for about 6 hrs after a full charger, for which the company guaranteed to provide atleast 12 hrs of usage after full charge.So guys i would recommend you, not to buy this product and instead go for ""Boat Rockkerz"" which cost only 1200Rs.

Comfortable to wear as compared to Realme buds. I own Realme buds 2 and now I have purchased this boult headphone.. This headfone is good for beginners. Also battery back-up for average daily use this is best. Bass thump is good. And best feature is it can connect 2 audio devices at the same time.Overall satisfied with the purchase.

Performance vice it is a nice product. While I was riding my bike I can't even slow down to talk. Voice cancellation is very much working in this. And also have a long long battery backup too.The only serious defect which I experienced is with the speaker cable. Very poor quality material is used for cable sleeve which is getting torned after 7 month use.If the manufacturer try to sort out this problem this will be a wonderful product.

This is my first review for any product on Amazon, propelled by the fact that, writing this review will get me a free movie ticket from Boult Audio. That being said, I will try to be as detailed as possible with my review. Boult Neckband Wireless Earphones were delivered to me by Amazon in it's effective one day delivery system, which is free for Amazon Prime users. I got the product at a bargain price of INR 999, after detailed comparison with an alternative, Boat 255. That being said, I have been largely satisfied with the overall experience of these earphones. Despite being satisfied with the earphones, why the three rating, you might ask? Well, the answer to that is two fold, first being, excessive bass, which is good, given it's price. However, the said bass, does not allow for crisper pitch or timbre. Secondly, the primary reason to purchase a wireless headset or earphones is convenience, which lacks at times with these earphones, owing to a very limited range and instances of lingo while listening to your choice of music (even when the phone is in your pocket). Overall, for the price, these are a good buy, despite it's shortcomings.

After 2 month,Read very carefully its help ( dhyan se padhna),Dosto acha earphone h. Battery backup bhi thik h. Connectivity bhi achi h.Per 100%-80% 2hr se 3hr hi battry chalti h, 60% me karib 4hr se 5hr chal jati h. Fir 40% me approx 30 min or 20%me battery chalti hi ni h, turant band ho jata h. To battery percentage partition sahi nahi h, jiske wajha se bhot jagha aapko problem ho jati h. Or aap is problem se bachna chahte h to 60% khtam hone se phle charge kar le. Qk travel me 60% complete hone ke baad aapka sath kabhi bhi chhod sakta h. Jo iska sabse bada weak point h.Sound quality awesome,Noise cancellation is also awesome,Bass quality is also 5 out 5,Battery back up is also very good 8 to 9 hrsBUT BATTERY PARTITION NEED TO IMPROVEMENT. ITS A HUGE MISTAKE OF BRAND.Over all 4.5 out of 5.

This was my first Bluetooth headset which I purchased. I did not have any idea about the brand and the sound quality of this device. But after I received and started using it , I decided this was the best Bluetooth headset I brought and the sound quality was awesome, with great trebles and decent bass and also the clarity of audio it delivered, and I can definitely say this is the best bluetooth headset in this price segment. People can buy this device

The other person can barely hear you while on voice call which fails the purpose of buying this device. Also, it is getting terminated on its own for some reason.

I was hoping that this one would be better but it is disappointment.

its been more than 6 month now since I started using it and it has been a pleasant experience. Construction quality is top class. The quality of the sound is excellent at the price. As the speakers have matured, the sound quality has improved. I also extensively use it for making and receiving calls and the call quality is good. The battery back up is decent, for my usage easily lasts 2-3 days and it has been consistent over the usage period. The only grouse I have is that its blue-tooth range seems to have reduced. Instead of the initial 25-30 feet, it seems to have halved to 12-15 feet. Could be specific to my headset. As an overall package, it is truly BANG FOR THE BUCK.

This is good and budget product, if you want a product Rs. 1000 range with decent base and sound quality then your search stop here. But when this became issue when you use it for any voice or other call. The other person call seems quite loud and heavy which sometimes not recognised. Battery pack up is good and build quality is also good. In nut shell, good for music and bad for calls.

The earphones stopped working in 3 months. It's only turning on when it's on charge. And switches off as soon as removed from charging.

Pros;Battery life and quality of sound is good, it can connect to 2 devices simultaneously which is also good.Cons:The sounds such as ‘connected’, ‘pairing’, ‘power on’ , ‘power off’ etc.. are dangerously loud and are extremely annoying.When the battery power falls below 20%, it repeatedly says ‘low battery’ once in every 5-10 secs in deafening loud sound. And it seems there is no way to reduce the volume of these sounds.

the bad thing about this product is that the battery is having issues while charging the battery gets puffed and become out of size and service center are only in delhi and if you sre from any other city or state you have to put your own expense and company is not going to pay for it... literally useless dont buy at all until they open service center for other city or states

Within one month of use, on-off button stopped working. It doesn't start at all. I am not even sure how to get the product replaced. Their service is pathetic. The number found in their website won't work. It says all lines are busy and ask to wait but after a short while, the phone disconnects automatically. Tried to send email on the mentioned email id also but no response. Total waste of money.

Tribal is good, Bass is not up to the mark. Can be connected with multiple devices using bluetooth but sound gets interrupted while using multiple devices. Like you connect it with laptop and mobile at the same time but sound will be interrupted. Fast charging last up to 7-8 hours of continues use. Build quality is good. Magnets behind the buds are not very strong have to stick them manually. Wires to the earbuds are too thin however they seems strong (After 2 months of continues use they are still intact)

male voice announcement for power ON OFF Connected disconnected. very annoying. instead simple tone would have been good. starts prompting battery low when 30% charge is reached. no provision to switch off the vibration alerts. connectivity max 5-6 feet only. all day battery.  just an average product at this price range.

Worst product in this price, sound quality and battery back up is too good but for only 7 months, after that one of the earpiece should not work.. then after some days both as well as the device should be useless. I am suggesting not to buy this product. I have also claimed and mailed for so many times but i got nothing. Thaats all. I will not suggest to any of my known persons.I hove gotten a new neckband as i claimed warrenty. Thank you boult team.Exchanged product is also defected... It stop working

HI there! It was wonderful experience of getting Boult wireless Bluetooth neckband earphone on time from Amazon.But it was short-lived. Reason behind that quality of this particular piece of earphone is  average and its durability is precarious. Hardly within 2months time span my one side earphone(magnetic driver) gets decided from it's fixation which extremely atrocious. Besides,being it in warranty period, I raised complaint for replacement ,bt I have got disgusting service because I need to send the earphone to Company's address which is quite aweful. If we talk about Boat audio in this aspect,its service is awesome i.e.home pickup and home delivery for replacement.Nonetheless, Neck band is also very fragile as it easily got deshaped. Sometimes earphone demands passcode to get connected.In comparison to Boat audio device, boat stands ahead in terms of quality , durability and  it has more esthetic and convenient design.Having been such costly product quality doesn't suits its quality.

This review isn't for the product but After Sales SERVICE/SUPPORTI purchased BA Bassbox Unplug and it's build and sound quality was good, battery gave a backup of 15-20 Hrs but dropped to 2-3 Hrs within 3 months, Contacted Support and they told me to send the speaker to them which would cost me Rs500+ for a Rs1200 Speaker.When I asked them about this, they stopped replying on email or cutting my phone.Now I'm even unable to call them on the Support number.Please BEWARE

Excellent product...Design and build quality looks are so very premium and light when you wear it. Its very much flexible and buttons are well responsive. Sound quality was very impressive and clear ...bass is ok....battery it's really great...it will last upto 6-7hrs if you listen to music or on call continuously.Connectivity is ok within 10ft distance..Finally it's really good ""value for money"" if you're interested go for it without wasting time...

Posting my review afer a month of use.I am facing some problems in the unit.1. One of the major problem I am facing is, When it connect to the Mobile, after 10 to 15 minutes of no use of bluetooth headset, and suddenly u have to receive a call the button of the bluetooth headset gets freezed. U didn't receive the call via headset and u hav to receive via the phone olny.2. Battery backup is not as mentioned it gave me 5 to 6 hrs.3. Cheap material used.4. The rubbery eartips got sleep frequently from headset.Not ideal for driving. Or jogging.in short It is usefull unless u have your mobile in your hand.

The first product that I had received was defective. It couldn't charge and there were startup issues. I had it repaired under its 1 year warranty. After repair, it's functioning as expected.It's a good budget option. It doesn't fall off during cardio workout sessions: the neck band stays intact. Music quality is okayish out of the box, but it would be better if you tweak it using your phone's Equalizer to meet your sweet spot. Multipoint connectivity is a useful feature and works fine with a Windows 10 laptop and Android 10 phone.

pros:: its very lite weight easy to carrying: very fast connection its content automatically when device is on within 0.5-1 sec: easily fits in ear: its support 2 devices connection: massive battery backup long lasting more than 12 hrs: 0% audio lags during gameplay like pubgcons: very very cheap sound quality: worst bass...i can't feel a 1% bass in this earphone: vocals are really worst: you can't feel any music or bass u only hear vocals and that's also very worst in this earphone: bluetooth connectivity is not working properly.. when puts on phone in pant while walking or jogging or cycling bluetooth range is little lagging

Boult audio ProBass curve has an optimum build and sturdy finish. Its light-weighted construction makes it extremely portable and comfortable. It's super flexible. The slack can be adjusted to the desired amount, as per need. The super-comfy earbuds have an great fit. The earpieces have embedded magnets on the ear tip. Just clip them off after use. This zeroes the chances of tangles. Whoa!  It has vibration motor in the neckband. This helps from missing your notifications even during streaming. You can enjoy your music without any sort of interruption. And there is no sort of latency. It has microwoofers built in. Finally a good value for money product

Regretting for choosing this product, it is made of cheap plastic, does not give confidence for casual handling.  Audio quality is very average and no bass. Only consolation is long battery life nothing else. Previously I was using Boat rockerz 600 and this Boult probass curve is nowhere near in sound or build quality. Audio quality for call is OK but if you intend to use for music listening then look somewhere else.

There was a connection problem since unboxing. Device disconnects even when I put my phone in my pocket.

Can't charge or switch on..I have ordered a replacement for the same.Hope it will be fine.

I can't give any rating to this coz I got earpain on one day of use. The other features may be good but what of their use if we can't hear without peace. The bass is generated and noise cancellation is  due to entirely closed ear which may give little thrill at beginning to have long term issue of ear problems. These extremel in ear canal earphones cause great damage to ears on long term use...

This bluetooth earphone is really amazing...Fit wise it is very comfortable...Sound quality is very nice...Like the bass...Vibration provided in the earphone is useful as well as irritating...They could have reduce the vibration...Quality of the earphone is upto the mark...Charging is also very fast...It is also have long battery life which is one of the most important highlight of this product...Overall rocking with boult...

Don't Buy this product after read my review , Otherwise you will waste your money on water.1.This product doesn't have well sound and bass too.2. Within 5 minutes usages Battery drained to ""0% after of  40%.3. This product doesn't fit well on ears , it's comes out from ears in every second.4. You couldn't play online games like ""PUBG"" ,""Call of duty' Due to sounds delivered to you very late or slow.5. Bluetooth could not reach one bed room to another any room. I mean music not comes in earphones.6.Noise cancellation is very poor,I don't think boult have provided noise cancellation on this neckband.

good and recommended if you are only going to use it for video and audio from mobile or pc/laptop.But not recommended for calls, as sometimes there is problem with audio wherein the audio is something like waves, not clear enough. Even tried replacement but even the replacement piece had the same issue did not replace it further.

I am using continuesly 3 days this headphone then I decided to review! I am reviewing this product not for bms voucher mentioned in boalt box!I am using also boat 255 headphone,But this boalt curve headphone is awesomeCrystal clear sound like wired premium headphone,Many person says it has connectivity issue. But I didn't notice, even many times testing a different ways!Battery backup upto 8 hours.If you are a bass lover then you will have to manage equilzer. If you correctly set a proper equilzer then it provides also a deep thumping bass(not heavy) with clear sound.Built quality is not too good in my opinion but fitted nice.under 1k this is a good deal. You can go with it without hesitation!

I wanted a bluetooth earphone that has good bass, but this lacks it, sound clearity is awesome but no bass at all my 400rs mi earphone gives an emersive bass experience as compared to this. Noise cancellation is passive so dont expect much.And I expected a better build quality, this feels flimsy.

So people who are confused between boat and boult, blindly go for this one.. This headset has excellent audio seperation, descent to good bass by adjusting the equilizer.. Unlike other brands in this price range even Minute details can be heard... Worth the money.. It suits perfectly in your ear.. Doesnt cause ear pain on continous usage...

Perfect BT Headphones for me as I can't use normal earbuds ;).Sound quality is awesome, very much comfortable to use due to bend earbuds and three different sized rubber cushions for all ear sizes is appreciable.My first piece delivered had some technical issues with keys but I got the replacement and it is working normally now.I loved this headphone.Final review: Feeling irated, this replacement product has no Mic or some problems in Mic. Not again, I like this headphone but unfortunately, all the products delivered are damaged internally. DON'T BUY

The product stopped working within 2 months of purchase. When I raised it with Boult as the product is in warranty, they are asking me to courier to an address in Delhi at my cost if I want repair or replacement. The cost courier will be ~ 300 Rs. which is ~25% of the price I paid for the product. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT CUSTOMER IS ASKED TO PAY FOR COURIER WHEN THE PRODUCT IS OF INFERIOR QUALITY AND STOPPED WORKING WITHIN 2 MONTHS OF PURCHASE. Don't recommend to buy any Boult product if this is the quality of their products and if they expect customer to spend time and money both to get repair or replacement during warranty period.

Worst Quality. I purchased this product on 8 august 2019 but after 28 august 2019 earphone stopped working. When I try to contact on support ..number not working no support. When I complain via email then he replied you need to courier product on the manufacturing address. Why I will spend my more money on this worst if you don't have any support why you are selling this product. Amazon also have request to ban this type of supplier from his website to selling product.

Overall a good product for music lovers or watching movie. Good sound quality but bass is not enough to give that effect which was portrayed in the advertisement. So if you are a bass lover then you might want to think over it. There has been connectivity issues the music hangs due to low receptive power especially while you are traveling or too much of wind around you. Solution: Try keeping your phone close to the earphones. I would say that battery and durability of this product is up-to the mark and I have no complaints. Hence overall a good product.

They refuse that.Product and product service both are very poor.Product also automatically switch off when using.I would not suggest anyone to buy this product.I have courier my product to service center after 10 days i have got my earphone back and its work for only one day now its not working again

Recently ordered Boult Audio Probass Curve (Black Color). All ordered items were as per the checklist. The performance of the device is as per the expectation with good sound and bass quality. Incoming phone calls are very clear and voice received at other end is also clear. Earbuds fit properly to your ears, as this is most important criteria I look into before buying an earphone. Neckband is flexible & comfortable to use even while jogging. Couldn't check battery backup until now. Overall I would recommend this product. Registered for warranty online and received call back from customer care executive confirming registration of warranty very next day.

Just after using 2 months now, the battery exhausts within half an hour even after a full charge and switching off. Due to its light weight, the instruments vibrates a lot when there is an incoming call. Since the return window time is closed now, therefore there is no opportunity for a replacement and refund. Suggesting, to avoid this product.

Issues in charging notification..From day 1 durig charging it was showing red light and once it was charged then red turns into blue.But now it's showing red during charging and there is a problem in connectivity also..Boult has one negativity..If I ask for replacement then they will ask me to courier that product at their office. Courier amount is not refundable, customer has to spend.Where as few other companies are giving full support after sell even in case of replacement. They never ask customer to courier the product. They provide product pick up facility.

Bought three boult  earphones.  The ear plugs of Boult Pro bass broke within 2 weeks of buying the same. Maybe it was due to some manufacturing defects or too flimsy.There was no mishandling.

Sound quality is good. And connection range is good for upto 10 feet without any objects in between. It takes a few seconds to switch audio between two devices. After a year, the rubber started to break and expose the inner wires and have little audio gaps while listening. So for 1 year, the product is good for listening only that bass is not very great.

I liked everything in this headset but there is one big problem.. The audio for the left comes in right and vice versa.. Playing games like PUBG will be very difficult.. I initially thought it may be just a problem with my headset and so got a replacement of this product, but the second one I got too had the same issue. I tested this using ""Left Right Stereo Test"" app. This is really unacceptable from the manufacturer where the basic testing has not been done.

It's okay to speak while using mobile phone calls. Not good for any of these call purposes like skype, Teams, Zoom. I can't hear properly as always a disturbing sound is coming while using with laptop( sound connection is not stable). So I have to connect my wired headset to hear properly. I'm not saying it's a waste of money but for me it doesn't serve the purpose.

Looks stylish but sound quality is not well when its on 100% volume, magnet is also not well still love it because of vibrator function. Wire length is well when we power on there is male voice not clearly finally i can say for 1199 not worth it should be under 1k.

Good ergonomics on this one. The neck bracelet is very helpful and non intrusive. Audio quality is good, however sound can be heard outside when the volume is too high. Not much of a bass fan, no comments there. Battery life is decent, lasts me for 4-5 days staying connected with calls throughout the day for office.Edit: No gripes with the product but Boult support contacted and offered a gift for writing review. I wrote one and then never honored the arrangent, hence moving the review to 1 🌟

 The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely, with box containing Boult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).The earphones look very good feels very light in hands, the neck band is very comfortable to wear and the ear piece made of metal and looks good.Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.The battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.

After few days of usage got fed up with it..Connection has issues sometimes with the mobile , with laptop its even more troublesome.Battery is horribly draining like anything, cant use it for proper duration as intended, is not average to be clear.Earbud magnets are now useless after few days.Charging cable was pathetic, broken within few days.Overall nothing to rely on this item to be a good headphones running through your day.

The product description mentioned is:""Boult Audio ProBass CurvePro Bluetooth Neckband with Vibration Alert for Calls, in-Ear Wireless Earphones with 12 Hour Battery Life, Fast Charging & in-Built Mic, IPX5 Sweat proof Headphones (Black)"".However, after using the device I realized that there is no ""vibration alert for calls"", i verified this by going through the supplied product manual as well.

Simple review in short:A budget earphone with just a decent sound but not so amazing or satisfactory.Build Quality is not upto expectation.Packing is good.The boult audio website says it has vibration alert but the product sold on Amazon doesn't have the same.

Waste of money. After 4 months of satisfactory service, right side earphone broke. It was under warranty so I contacted Boult Audio via mails. They did't even pick up from my place for repair service I had to courier it to the given address. And then they said they don't repair products they will send me a new one. But the new one was worse than old one. It had software problems and connectivity issues too. Buttons were not working properly either. Never buying anything from Boult.

This wireless bluetooth earphones good, ergonomic, magnetic (stick to each other at centre so that you wont misplace it while wearing), good noise cancellation, exorbitant bass, best stereo and dolby/ 4k sound effects... Battery life is one of the best in industry i.e. it gave 3-4 days of backup while just used for calling. Just safety advice don't listen to songs/ avoid talking on phones while you drive!

1. Sound quality is good. I started using this for my meetings and I see that people are hearing my voice better than before.2. Its flexible around the neck and at the same time stable.3. The thing that I liked most is that the voice communication about the status of the earphone (like saying ""power on"", ""pairing"", ""connected"", ""disconnected"", ""power off"". My other brand earphone just beeps differently for different actions, which is sometimes difficult to understand.

Pro's1. it's super light weight. U wouldn't even feel there's something sitting on ur neck.2. U can adjust the size of the ear piece wire which is awesome. It need not keep hanging all the way down all the time.3.  Sound out put, bass, noise cancellation is all awesome. I was Neva keeping it at full volume even while driving. It's that good.4. Battery life is fantastic. 1.5 to 2 days easily.ConsThe only con is that the build quality doesn't look very premium for some reason. Not that it looks cheap but doesn't feel premium either. That's all.

I have been using these neckband for more than a week now. My honest review is that it's okey for the price but does not meet the expectations.The earbuds are comfortable and the band is very light. The sound quality is not up to the mark and definitely a no for music lovers. Bass is not as expected nor is the highs... I'm not against the product but my expectations were quite high I guess. There are connectivity issues and the battery lasts for close to 6 hours on 80 percent volume. I'm planning to go for the truefive true wireless earphones. Hopefully the performance is better.For the price of INR 999 maybe ok but it would be well worthwhile to invest on something else...

Bought this one as I have used earlier neckband. It had good vibration feature and sound quality was great. So bought a new one keeping in mind the quality of the previous neckband. The new one disconnects very frequently and says ""connected"" every two minutes. In between, if any call comes, it does not connect automatically. We have to press few buttons to make it work. Even vibration feature is not very effective. We can hardly feel the vibration when phone rings. The music and bass quality is good while playing songs.

*sound quality (especially after using EqualizerFx app) is amazing*CONNECTIVITY IS HORRIBLE! it loses connection stability when you place your phone in your jeans butt-side pocket while standing or walking.

Excellent product.. The quality of the product is very impressive. Earphones are very light and flexible.Sound quality is very clear and smooth. And the bass quality is very impressive and outstanding.Battery: In this headset I like most is that it's battery backup. It last around 2 to 3 days from your charging. And charging is very fast it take you only 45 to 55 min for 70% to 80% charging.Finally if you are looking for a headset this is the product you must check out first. At last this product is ""Value for money"". Don't think buy it.

A true value for money product, been using this on a regular basis for the past 6 months. The neckband and its style aesthetics look terrific. Coming to the sound aspect of it, it meets all your daily needs, i primarily use it at the gym and during my jogs and while commuting, the sound is punchy and well rounded. The only piece i had to swap were the silicone ear buds which kept falling off, changed them with my AKGs now.

I do not have option to give less than one star thats why giving one star. I am writing this review after 5 months of use. In beginning it worked fine. However, after 3 months I started facing issue in getting it connected. Now, after 5 months it's stoped taking charge. I wrote to the customer care but they do not care to response on the warrantee claim. They provide you warantee only for Namesake. Even purchasing this expensive product they do not provide dedicated customer service. Totally dissatisfied.

So there are 4 main reasons that I love this product.1. Sound quality2. Noise cancellation3. Comfort4. Battery life.No doubt boult audio give best sound effects, but there is something different about Curve pro, it gives amazing sound experience along with noise cancellation,  the ovel earbud design provides great comfort and also reamin in place while runnig or during workout.Inline control and voice assistant makes this experience much better.Lastly it's battery life, though battery life is mentioned 12 hrs I've experienced a little more battery life.Overall best product.

I don't understand why the box seal are open. I bought two Bluetooth earphones, one was day before yesterday and today but seal was open and gum strength was strong on other side, I realized that some thing is happening. And it is written that if the seal is broken don't take the box, but how can I know until I open the packages, Delivery boys they just give but they won't wait. OK , if I return the devices I will get other, but still the ridiculous thing is why those seal are open even though this has strong adhesive. But I feel ok with what I got because I am trust Amazon .

I am an unsatisfied customer. The product came to me with the batteries charged to about 80%. Tried charging it to 100% before use, so kept it for charging for about 30 minutes. Did not check at that time whether it was charging.After about 8-10 hours of use, the message of low battery came. I then tried charging, and attached the device using the charging cable that came along with the product. But the charging indicator light was not showing, and the product could not be charged. Tried charging with other good quality charging cables, but with the same result.Applied for a replacement, and awaiting the replacement. Will update later

It's a Okay neckband ,not quite expected. Sound Quality is just normal, nothing extraordinary. It mentioned multi phone connect but it does not work. Moreover, after a month of purchase central button for call pickup doesn't work. Had ask support to check but support is slow response and moreover asked to courier product at my cost which is not nice as its product fault and company should arrange pickup for repair/replacement. Was more expecting from product and company but not disappointed

I had purchased this product during the sale. I am writing this review after using it for almost a month and it has been an amazing experience. The sound, bass and noise cancellation is best considering the price range. The look and feel of the product looks premium. Furthermore, you can adjust the wire depending on your requirement and it isn't dandling around your neck. If you are looking for a Bluetooth neckband below Rs. 2000, go for it.

If you’re looking for bass then I’d suggest you to go for it. This is my first experience with boult neckband and it’s amazing.The bass is just outstanding, I’ve compared it with my other neckbands but it couldn’t give me thump of boult. It’s noise canceling feature is cool and snugs right into your ear. All the sounds are perfectly balanced with its thumping bass. The call quality is clear the other person could hear you without any disturbance. It connects so quick while pairing. It got 3d acoustic for real. If you increase the volume more than 60% you can feel the mini woofer in it. Overall the product reached my expectations.😃

My Package Got delivered very fast within 4-5 days . And I had no issues regarding the package . But the box was little damaged on the corners . Bu it's ok . The earphones were safe inside. I got all the contents which was mentioned in the product description. But a few of them got a movie voucher , but that was not mentioned . But that's fine.....ABOUT THE PRODUCT :The neckband looks good to me and has got a premium look outside. Talking about the built quality  , I found it better for the price . But the buttons were a little lose , as it had a sound coming when I just touched it .AUDIO PERFORMANCE:The songs I played were rocky songs and some bollywood love songs , both sounded good ! The earphone has got A good base , which gives a good effect. But it has got medium sized ear buds plugged on it , and I dint try wearing the small sized earbuds. The medium sized earbuds were a little lose and I had to press a little when I was listening to music.  I hope the small ear buds go well on my ears. !CONS ( PROBLEMS REGARDING IT )◆The neckband slips from my neck and come back when I am running .◆I don't get calls on the earphones .◆The call comes on My phone , and the earphone doesn't vibrate while the call is ringing.◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆This is all the problem I faced with the earphones. Rest everything is fine .BOULT COMPANY , please fix my problem of connecting the neck band when I am on Call .

I have been using this blutooth earphone since 24 hours and my experience so far is...1.Sound quality is quite impressive in this price range.2.Bass is also good.3.Bluetooth connectivity is just above the average (won't trouble you a lot).4.Battery backup is awesome.For me it is a win win deal because, I purchased it for a price of Rs. 899/- that to with Rs. 750/- cashback I got on a smartphone deal. For me it just costed Rs. 149/-

 The adjustable strip has too loose, so that I can't adjust it properly. Even I adjust for my requirement, after some time it will goes down.This is 2nd time I'm returning this for same cause.Sometime bluetooth function isn't working properly. I can't hear nothing through earphone during the calls.

Stumbled upon this very old question while searching for how this brand is performing now.I’d bought their model known as Boult while keeping fingers crossed. The product has lasted me good for more than a year. The battery is great and for the price of 1300 or so was okay , you cannot ask for a better sound quality in a wireless earphones.This confidence have made me to buy one more wireless earphones from the same brandNot sure about other people’s experience, mine has been pretty great.

Excellent Product, worth to buy Qualitative and Quantitative both Ways Good. Best Sound Quality Soft Button. Nice Charging port (though old Fashioned Type-B) best Battery Backup and Quick Battery Recharge. Noise Cancellation good Low Price and Extremely soft on Ears.Perfectly Compatible with what they Claim.*Only One Thing that I hated about it is When it Turns on It Has Annoying Welcome Tune ""Power On"" and ""Connected"" (which is irritating and Loud on Ears). I want that disabled I hope there is some option.

It's good product but for those who love sad songs and watch movies becs its hd sound give you best experience of it.Yaa but it's not good for base lover people becs the base is not that much good or i say u don't feel base it has Little base and of you are gym lover u have to buy it becs ye nikalte he nhi hai yrr kaan mai jese bs song chlre h pta he nhi chlta. And vibration effect is removed from this product which makes its battery life move then 13hr by songs so standby mai nd call maybe 24hr to 30hr cross  easily  kr deyge. I am useing it from last 2 week and still it's is best i don't have any complain regarding it.

Im purchasing this for second time coz i was very happy with quality of earphones purchased earlier. But this one is really bad. There is echo problem. I think this is manufacturing defect .

The earphones looks very Elegant.It feels very light  and comfortable around neck and is really very soft .The ear piece is made of metal and attched together via magnets placed inside them.The battery backup is pretty decent and one can easily get minimum 12 hours of play time through this being connected to Phone via Bluetooth having version 5.0Best value for money and and is really good at cancelling Noise.

I bought this product after knowing that new boult headphones earphones are launched which I needed very much. I was tired of using wired earphones no matter how much I used, how branded I used the wire always used to break up. So this time I have gone for wireless one.Now let's come to point this earphones have good sound quality you can feel it. Left earphone has less volume but not that much it will work fine. Noise cancellation is very good. Bass is excellent. It's also lightweight. I will tell you go for it if your heart tells it and if any problem occurs you can claim warranty. Sure their is also room for improvement. Keep it up Boult.

Better than Samsung level U and other products . Vendor is offering some Gift voucher for the rating so you will not trust the rating whoever posting herePros :1. Good battery backup (8-10 hrs) -- great thumbs2. Adequate bass and treble , you will never get this sound quality as compared to price tag3. Good build qualityCons :1.  Poor Bluetooth range ,even not more than 3mtrs .2. Poor voice clarity . I can rate 3/52.  Hard earbuds -- unbearable :-( .

Boult Bluetooth Wireless Neckband Earphone is Best at this price range. I got it in Independence Day sales at Only Rs 999.Battery backup is more then 12 hrs. Also recharge very quick with in 2 hrs for full charge. Led indicator is good to tell about what is going on with voice support by neckband.I really recommend this product at this price range.
"
2933,"
Let me start with the conclusion, These headphones just plain suck. This is a complete waste of money. These don’t have Bluetooth 5.0 like the page says, their packaging says it has Bluetooth 4.2. The packaging is horrible, the “logo” on the ear pieces is basically a poorly centered sticker that can come off with minimal effort. The sound quality is remarkably poor for this price. Low bass output and tinny treble. Overall pretty false advertising. The icing on the cake is the way they’ve managed to package the extra ear buds into a ziplock bag. This poor quality is unacceptable if you’re claiming an MRP of around 5k INR. Disappointing.
"
2934,"
Pros- Sound quality is good for this price range. Noise cancellation is also good. Bass quality is something where I am slightly disappointed. I lack a little quality in case of bass. The sound is produced ifor this price range is adequate or goodish. The battery backup is also good. Continue it can last almost 8-10 hours or almost 2 days back up. But I miss vibration on call. Though some of the review says it vibrates when a call comes.  But my one doesn't have this feature. Although company didn't mention this feature anywhere so I didn't take is as faulty. If there is any process to turn the vibrate on please somebody let me know
"
2935,"
Sound quality is good, it gives you a good listening experience. Battery life is really good, lasts you 12-13 hours easily on a single charge. Noise cancellation is also decent.The only drawback I have find is, the material to make the band ends feels like cheap plastic, which isn't clear to see on the photos, but the heads are good quality metal.Also, the Bluetooth connectivity dips a bit at times, but not very often.Overall I am happy with this product!

Why is my box different than everybody else's?Bought it on 11 aug 2019... The inside packaging was really bad especially the frame that held the neckband which made me doubt the genuinity of the product... Range isn't good... The audio starts cutting from a little distance only... Sound quality is ""okay""... Less than expectation but still it's okay... The material of neckband is also okay, there's nothing to complain about in the material but the wire could have been thicker or flat ones bec the ones in these look fragile... I'm writing this review only after a day's use... I used it for 6 hours or more and the battery is still 50% and this is the only thing that I like about these earphones... Idk about the warranty yet... The card was there tho.I've seen other reviews and my box and it's contents seem to be different than any of those in the review which is making me feel a bit skeptical about if they're actually genuine...Hope the warranty is genuine and they work well for long (you don't buy earphones for a few months use, do you? You want them to work for a couple of years at least...

Very nice product with lots of features like; sound quality is very good, magnetic earbuds, TTS engine for the device on/off,  speak caller-id, etc. Value for money. I don't find any other product with all such features and built quality. Very light-weight neckband that is not at all irritating during the workout. Battery backup is also very good (8-10 hrs of listening time)The feature I like the most is its vibration in the neckband on any incoming call. It notifies you with the vibration when an incoming call comes and your magnetic earbuds are tied up in the neck.Overall its a very good deal in this price range.

Okay so I am giving this a 5 star review so this gets highlighted.  I bought two of these Bluetooth earphones as gifts. One stopped working after 3 days of use and the other one stopped after 3 uses.

Brought this many months back, and it's working perfectly. Use it very often for listening to music and for phone calls. Good sound quality and a bit of noise cancellation. One charge lasts 5-6 days with 3-4 hours of use per day. Worth the money. Update in May 2020. Unit stopped charging and died.RIP.

Not upto the mark, i was not expecting this poor quality, boult is a good brand but this particular model is not at all good, low base, nk surround sound, low volume, but material is good. Better is to go with boult s06 cheaper and awesome surround and base far far better than this model and under low price. Don't expect much with this product plus the price is too high. Rest is your decision your money...

The reason i gave it 5 stars is because it is absolutely worthful! I bought it while there's an offer and it cost me Rs 1100 only. If there's a stars more than 5 i would give it more than that. I love this product. The sound quality is exceptional and it's beyond my expectations. It's a little bit late in recieving but that don't bothered me at all. Guys, if you're planning buying bluetooth earphones for low budget but excellent quality, go for this. It won't disappoint you, 100% guaranteed. I absolutely love this.

The product is generally good and pair/connect with mobile/laptop. However it does not pair with the smart TV. I have a Sony Bravia TV and despite repeated efforts it is not pairing/connecting with it. The TV is easily pairing/connecting with other BlueTooth devices but is not able to search/identify this headset even when it is in a pairing mode.Also as per the manual it should vibrate when swtiched on or off but instead of vibrating it only send sounds ""Power on"" or ""connected"" etc.  this means that vibrating feature is wrongly advt.

Sound quality and the bass is absolutely brilliant, but the built quality is too cheap, it worked well for first 3 months, but after that it's power button started causing problems. Though sound quality was good at that time as well, but as now after 9 months, it completely stopped working with the power button kind of broken or what, I don't know. Maybe this is a fake product. Don't know, wasn't able to claim warranty as well, as the QR code of the warranty card doesn't works.

Disliked it because the product falls from your neck while you are walking or you are doing any activity.Being a neckband, even if you adjust it as per your need, it band goes left to right and vice versa as per your movement and reaching on peak, it falls from your neck.A big no for such produt.Also, Amazon does not have a refund policy for this product so thank you Amazon for pathetic experience!

I bought the wireless head phone 2 months ago. but now its not charging. The product has 1 year warrenty. So i searched on gooogle for the service center near me. At that time i came to know. They dont have any service centre. On their website they are having 2 mail ids and a contact no. but they are not replying for any of your mail and mobile is on auto voice mail. By which they send me 1 sms with a link to submit my complaint. After submitting the complaint they ask me to courier the whole product along with the original box to check the problem and if there would be problem than they will send new product. So just to repair the product 1 has to spend extra money to courier it. And after that also i dont think so there woulb be proper solution to your complaint as one is there there to send you any reply.Total waste of money and time. Pathetic product with pathetic service. Dont buy this.

This product is useless if you're on the move.

Got this product at Rs. 999 on 8.8.19.Considering the price the product is decent.Pros: Good battery life and low charging time, budget friendly, decent sound quality, can connect to multiple devices simultaneously.Cons: Plastic used is cheap, bass could be more clear, the speaker placement is not perfect as it makes some chirping sound when pressure is applied, listening music on a volume above average leads to minor head ache.

Awesome headset. Mainly bought so I can listen to songs and attend calls when I'm riding by bike. Sounds quality is outstanding. I was not expecting this kinda bass quality from a simple headset like this.  It snugs within helmet without any disturbance.

The headphones stopped working in 7 days. Very worst product. When I switched on the headphones It started vibrating heavily. I thought it was going to burst.

So simply threw the headphone away.

Waste of money , horrible product . Not working properly . I didn't get a brand new product , Bluetooth  head set package seal was already opened and no user manual inside .Issue with the seller : I got package from Amazon and Amazon packing seems to be good but after I opened the Amazon package, I noticed that Bluetooth headset packing seal was broken , after I opened the package I noticed that no user manual inside , I suspect that they replaced original one with defective or some already used product . I lost confidence on this seller and eventually on Amazon to encouraging these kind of sellers.Issue with product : Item is not working properly . I kept charging for the whole day and still struggling to turn on it . After several attempts ( easily I tried for at least 30 times ) I was able to turn it on and after turn on it when we click on volume buttons again Bluetooth is turning off. Horrible product . And from then i couldn't turn on it till now . I am very much disappointed with this product . It's waste of money

I've been using it from weeks now and I think now is the time to give a review. I can tell you this that only weight you feel on your ears is of the sound of music, it is light as feather and battery life is amazing (I used it for more than 12 hours (5,6 hours ideal).

Within this price range including the deals the bluetooth earphone is quite good. The Price range is also nice.

I have purchased this product's old varient, and I experienced no issue at all during my 1.5 years usage.Now I have purchased this varient a day before yesterday. I like the changed design. Although it comes in a plastic body to make it light in weight yet the design and neckband are just amazing.In terms of sound quality the bass is amazing, highs and lows are decent (good for the price range) vocals are clear as well.Noice isolation is just amazing in this pair. They are really comfortable to the ears as well due to its 60 degree design of earbuds.No major issue as of now.

It's good one but... Can't here for long time..It's my experience as I have a migran issue.After listening for 2 Hours... I feel very bad headache...Not preferable for the sensitive people...If you don't have any giddy feel about Bluetooth.. you can go for it

Am using this earphone for about 10 months now and i loved this earphone. I have checked other brands earphones in this price range brands like Boat Noise but they all disappointed me. This earphone have best sound quality than any other brands. Good bass and comfortable to use.Good bluetooth connection.Only disadvantage is build quality but still it satisfies me. Best earphone for workout.

So here is the thing.. i got the reference of these earphones from a colleague at work.. i was looking to buy a Bluetooth Earphones and he suggested me this..After using this for a week: Sound quality is best, i mean it catches all the sounds happening in a song.:Bass is not too much high but if you're like me and dont need extreme boom so you're welcome yo buy.: maybe uncomfortable for some on y'all but they provide you extra earbuds so adjust according to your need..:battery backup is real deal here. Its actually so good that i can use it without thinking about charging..:It is Water resistant, iam a sweaty guy and i have seen sweat gone inside but still works fine after few blows..so if you're looking for bluetooth earphones under 1500.. I can't suggest you bettet than this..

product review based on 2 weeks of usage -1. battery gets charged quickly and last for 2 days with normal usage of calls n songs.2. pairing is quick and efficient switching over multiple connected device (tried with max of 2 at a time).3. Sound quality including bass is fairly decent.4. buds are not very much comfortable while using during bed time.

The product got delivered to me on 2nd October 2019 and suddenly it stopped working on 17th February 2020.Its battery back up is not responding once removed from charging port.Wasn't expecting this kind of problem so early on that I might have used it only for about 2 months in the mentioned time period. Dissatisfied Disappointed.Edit : After giving it for repair they fixed the issue, still giving 4 star as their employee told to charge it through portable battery or desktop /laptop and not through adapter as it may burn the circuit which I feel is a drawback.

Hello all I have heard it for the first time the brand boult and I must tell youthat the sound quality and the bass quality is so good I cannot even hear outside noise when I put it on... the range of the Bluetooth is so good in my big hall also it covers the range connected... it's pure value of money ..you should buy it. the sound quality is so crisp and clear. The headset are so flexible and equality of headset is too good... charge it for 2 hours and it will play for around 12 to 13 hours continuously ...I am in love with this product these days

Build quality is very cheap,battery and remote housings are made out of chap plastic ,they are not solid,buttons are placed loosely,they jiggles when touched.Seems like if you sit on it it will definitely shattered,i also worry about sweat resistance.I have also boat rockerz 255..that is more solid and more quality product in tearm of build qualityNo vibration alert on incoming calls or on/offSound quality is very good,very clear sound,bass quality is ok ok..not over poweredBattery is yet to evaluate

Bolut curve neckband is a very good product under 1k Indian rupees. I had bought this on Amazon sale for rs 999..Pros-*Good quality sound, both bass and treble is too high..so for a pleasing sound you should have to download third-party equaliser software program, because inbuilt phone eq. doesn't work on it though it's a Bluetooth neckband.*battery life is great..Cons-*Built quality on the side pannels of neckband seems cheaper like rs200-300 type product.should be improved by using soft plastic.*the first tap for the volume and next button is annoying.. for next or previous track you have to press and hold for around 2-3 sec...it should be like one tap for next or previous track and press and hold to increase or decrease volume.

This is a decent product that you can get alternative to boats 255.. this has better sound stage than boats and a more balanced sound signature compared to the boats.. boats are bass heavy that muffles other sounds... Contrary this doesn't have a lot of bass despite their claim to have micro woofers... so if you are a bass beast then go for the boats... Battery life is quite good it lasts me the entire day from 10 o clock in the morning to 8 in the evening... Connectivity is quite good... Taking calls also works well... I never liked the sound signature of boats so i went for these instead and I am quite happy.. build quality is good too... Couple tips.. let the earphones burn in, that is play some songs for a couple of hours or the whole night then listen to them they will sound a lot better and use the eartips that will give a complete seal in your ears... For this i am using the largest tip provided in the box.. and get the red one if you can it looks the best😆😆

While these headphones are great for phone calls, I am very disappointed with the quality of music playback on these. I use these on my bicycle rides, and the music playback severely lacks quality. However, the call sound quality is great and the other person can hear you loud and clear so I guess it does that job really well.Also, the earbuds don't fit too well (I've tried different sizes). Maybe I'm inserting them wrong but they just didn't work well for me.

Thank you amazon for this lovely product I am happy to buy this product it's amazing 😍 the sound quality is perfect but the bass is totally 🤯 impressive. I mean I had never found this type of bass quality in any other headphones. Noise cancellation are also nice it gives me the absolute sound through my ears. This product kept the trust and worth of my money 😌. You can go for it 👍.

Don't go for it..I am writing this after using 4 months. Don't trust these reviews because these boult company agents are calling each person luring them rewards for 5 ratings given for these headphones & posting them in WhatsApp. So don't go by reviews.After using 4 months , i found that these are not worth 999 rupees . Please buy any other headphones like boat , realme , oneplus...even for some what heigher price.Because some beep sound coming .pairing also not that much good.

I own a Boult Audio already and recently bought the ProBass one. The bass quality is better along with better overall sound fidelity. They have got rid of the annoying vibration mode, which was nice. Overall happy with the purchase. The microphone is good and conversation clarity is quite good. Wireless connectivity with both laptop and phone at the same time is a blessing. Allows one to toggle seamlessly between calls on either and not be locked to the seat.One negative however is the bluetooth range. Says 10m, but doesn't cover beyond 5-10 feet. You will hear the sound fade off or get wobbly as you walk away from your connected device beyond a distance. But, I am fine to live with that shortcoming.Good price at Amazon.

Doest connect to more than one at a time. Microphone can't catch our voice until we keep on the mouth. If you only want to listen to music  or watch movies then fine . If you want have phone conversation just search for something else.

Build-up quality is average types... bricks are made up of poor quality plastic and buttons are also not that great.I myself bought this product after seeing such an excellent reviews but now i wonder.... what made them write such thing.From my experience i am saying....the Bass is very low apart from that treble and medium is also ok types. If you want high bass and premium look then this product is not for you.

I got this neck band at Rs 999 during sale. So I really can't complain much. At this price range this is a good option. Below are the some pros and cons.Pros1. Price. During no sale it costs Rs 1399-1499. During sale you can get it at low as Rs 9992. Bluetooth version 5. So no lag while watching YouTube/Netflix. Audion Video sync is good. Clear sound3. Battery backup. Though the company claims of 10 hours, it gives around 5-6 hours heavy ussage (continuous music and voice call) if the battery is 100% charged.4. Good packing by Amazon. Provides 1 year warranty and 2 extra pairs of ear buds.5. Magnetic ear pieces. So that it does not get loose from your neck.Cons1. Built quality not so good. The bend is off flexible plastic. The wire is too thin. Seems cheap quality material is used. Can be torned anytime if proper care not taken.Buttons are not so good quality. May damage soon if you use it continuously. So use your phone's volume rocker/call receiving buttons.2. Company claims of high bass, but bass is not that good. If your phone is high end, the music is good but other wise you ll miss the bass part. Treble is high. You may need to do some manual setting in your phone to get the best output.3. Bluetooth range is not that good. Can be good if you use it in one room. If you go to another room it will give you hicups. I used it in my balcony and my phone was in the room, I found the connectivity is not so good. You can use it within max 10 feet radius without any wall or solid obstacle.So this is it. As I said at this price range I really can't complain or find any cons. So if you are looking for a Rs1000-1200 range Bluetooth band. Go for it. Even if it works for 1 year or so without any problem, it's Paisa vasool. Do let me know your review on this

This is one of the best product which I have bought in wireless headphones. Its sound quality is the best while comparing with other products. Easy to wear and less weight are added quality so it's become more useful. Bass quality is decent. A most important quality is Noise Cancellation. It's Bluetooth wireless range around 10-15 Mtr.Its battery backup is approximately 10-12 hr.So I suggest you guys buy this product if you want the best wireless headphone. Last week, one of my friends bought this product after I suggest him to buy.

Well, this is a good product at INR 1799? But I guess the users have mostly given 4 or 5 star to maybe get those free movie tickets!Anyways, expecting something like a Skullcandy or Bose' sound would really be not legitimate here with a Boult INR 1799 earphones but it's a good product. The expectation comes because in past with products like QCY Bluetooth earphones have been so good with the sound quality. Although the durability was questionable! Can't comment for this one since it has been just 3-4 days. And yes, the in ear long time experience would be bad. Means it will hurt, not a bit but I guess a lot more. But again 1799? It's a fair show. If you want something more better in all regard, then shell out more bucks.Thanks

I bought this at the time of prime sale so got it for pretty cheap price.However, I as excited I was awaiting for the product to be delivered, I had a contrasting feeling once it was delivered. Below are the reasons.1. The boult would not connect at all. I thought initially due to lack of sufficient charge it was causing this issue. But, it was later even post full charge, and it was refusing to connect.2. I was disappointed and called the customer care and they asked me to return to Amazon which I did. It wasn't vibrating as well when there was an incoming call as the company claims.Hence, got it replaced with another one which worked as expected but still there is no vibe on incoming call.Overall, I the bass effect, sound quality is fair enough for the pricing. The built and make is of premium quality that really makes this stand out for this pricing

It is better than any other bluetooth earphone I have used. The sound quality and the bass is on point. I just have one problem that my earphone just stopped working suddenly. Its been only 2 months since I purchased this. I was very happy with the product and specially the playing time and charging. Just love it. My product is still in warranty if I could get some help from Boult service team it would be very helpful. I would like to see that the after sale service of Boult is as good as their product

This is my first product from Boult. Let me give a slight brief that the company Boult Audio and Boat both are indian brands.Now, coming to the product Boult Audio Airbass Powerbuds.Better than its predecessor Boult Audio Airbass TrueBuds in terms of:1. Battery obviously, the buds itself has a battery of 45mAh and the case has 2200 mAh of battery.2. The charge in the buds lasted for 6 hours approximately,In my use.3. The logo on the buds lights up in blue color while charging and blinks white when charged fully. And trust it looks awesome!4. the case open and pair feature works fantastically.5. Very very comfortable to wear for long hours, a very optimal improved design than its predecessor.6. The box suprisingly is not that big and bulky as it seems here in the pictures.7. The audio is fantastic. The bass is up to mark. No complaints. Sound is loud and clear, overall a very impressive sound for indian audiophiles.8.call quality is good. It do register surrounding noises but the main voice is registered appropriately and loud.9. The front pannel of the case has the ""Type C"" port for charging and ""Usb A"" for charging your phone as it can act as a powerbank also.10. Latency while playing pubg is not that much. The game is playable.11. Touch controls works fine.Now some cons:1. No mention of driver size here in the manual.2. The case quality is good. But the lid feels a little loose. Dont get me wrong the build quality is good but its just the lid which is a bit loose.Thats it!The product is very much recommendable. Just Go for it!

Purchased during Prime day and reviewing it after a couple of days of usuage. Design looks stylish and premium. Especially the LED on buds look awesome. Sound quality is descent. Following are my observations.Pros:- Lows, mids and highs are crisp and clear- Bass is up to the mark- Lightweight- Buds feel premium in design- Indoor voice clarity is good during calls- Ipx7 rating- Very good battery life (I had 4hrs with a single charge)- Nice build quality (Doesn't feel cheap)- No connectivity issues found as suchCons:- Buds feel slightly bigger in size- Bass could have been better- Charging case is bit heavy (as it houses 2200mah battery)- Difficult to manage between voice assistant and volume adjustment ( Triple tap for voice assistant could have been better)- No AptxOverall it's a decent product within its price range and satisfied with its performance.

Really disappointed with this product.  I waited around 2 weeks to have this product in my hand and was very much excited on receiving it. But all of it went wrong while started using it ... even though it is showing a long listed features on its manual I didnt felt it as special at all.... especially while making a call ..... price wise this is not worthy at all .....i spend around 2500 rs ... on this and really regretting on it.... the main use of a Bluetooth is to listen to audio and make calls... this is not good in both ....... no bass or any special audio features and while making a call the other person can't hear any thing ....the voice keeps on breaking .......please note that this dont have refund.....only replacement....would say cheating with cheap products at next level...

Bought this in the prime day sale. I have used boult wireless ewrphones before and quite impressed with build and performance compared to say, boat which is also same price range. So I bought this probuds and also a boat yes for my daughter.Coming back to this, the charging case looks and feels solid. Taking the buds out of the case needs some knack as there's no grip space of any kind and it tends to slip. I guess this depends on the dexterity of the person!Once out of the case, it pairs immed.The shape is a little, well interesting. The manual infact gives instructions on how to wear it! So you can imagine! Anyways after a few tries I found my right snug fit.Music plays well. Don't expect much bass but music clarity is crisp. I tried to increase and decrease vol from buds and it works ok but it takes some adjustment to get used to it since it has some 5-6 levels that are very closely spaced to one another and it's best used when your mobile is not with you.Voice call clarity was decent, however and this is the biggest issue I found so far - I lose the BT pairing every now and then WHEN ON CALLS. Music there is no problem and it plays continuously but on calls, every 5-6 min the buds lose connectivity and I need to select the buds option again (instead of phoe or speaker) and it reconnects. Thisnis needless to say very frustrating and could be a deal breaker.I  tried resetting but it doesn't solve the problem.I read another review that said this is a problem with internet calls. I have the problem on both internet calls (like on zoom or Cisco WebEx) and normal calls.The only other gripe was you tend to accidentally touch the buds touch area when adjusting while running or if it's causing discomfort and the bud reacts to it by pausing music or disconecting calls ! I found this y'day when I used it while taking calls during my run. It's not a deal breaker as this functionality is by design but it's overtly sensitive. For some this may be ok.Overall, at this time for the budget price range, it's decent but Boult needs to provide a software update asap for the call disconnects. Hope they are reading all this feedback.

On 25th if September, I ordered boult audio airbass powerbuds.  It was showing lot of problems. Like sound disappearing from one earbuds, despite of showing full charge. So, within the replacement period I replaced the product and got a new one on 30 th of September. Again I started facing similar problems but it was for sometime I thought the product is like that when it losses the charge. I used it like that for some days. When the Amazon product replacement period ended. It started showing it's true colours. Charge was showing 100% . But, sound was lost from both them together. I put it to charge, after 2 hours I tried to connect it via Bluetooth with my mobile. It was showing no media. I wasn't able to do anything. I did everything mentioned in the manual still, the problem continued. It was in the case for whole day, next day it  became normal. Still, there was some noise disturbances. Often the products shows full charge,  but it gets power off, then gets turn on automatically, losses pair, gets paired... It shows completely mad behaviour. When sound gets completely lost from the buds, despite of showing full charge, I connect it to my case, to charge it. But, it doesn't show any charging light. It white blinks, then stops completely. I'm truly very disappointed and dissatisfied with this product. I don't want any replacement again. I want you to take this product back, because this product is already very new.  17 days old. And, give my money back. Guys buy this product from boult at your own risk. Because, i'm sure you will never be satisfied.

This product is crap. Could not attend calls because the left mic was non-functioning straight from the box. I was foolish to assume that it's a 2k product so, you cannot expect anything else, only to later see a YouTube review of the product where the reviewer shows himself attending calls. Further investigation revealed that the left mic was bad, but it was too late to replace it then. Boult service centers are absent in India and you need to pay for the courier charges if you wish to get it fixed.So, you pay to get the earbuds, they give you a faulty product, and then you PAY AGAIN to send it to Delhi to fix their mistake. WOW...just WOW. Help yourself and stay away from Boult. Get yourself a brand whose service center is near you, if you cannot afford AirPods.Received the product after repairs from the Boult Service Center and there is no improvement, the mic quality is as good as rotten. You cannot use them to attend calls. Save yourself from this electronic disgrace.Recently got a call from Boult's representative who insisted that I delete my bad review. Is that even legal? I was asked to remove this bad review and give at least ""THREE STARS"" if I am not happy with the product. This is a multi-dollar company we are talking about. Not only do they provide bad product and deplorable after sales service, but also carry the nerves to call you and ask you to change your review at the cost of getting a replacement.Not only my last Boult product but I will do everything in my power to make sure none of my friends and family ever purchases anything from this dubious company.

Received the product yesterday, delivery is good as always.Pros1. Quality of the music and videos is very good. Balanced music, was able to hear all ranges. I am not a bass head, maybe bass heads will not like it.2. Fit in ear is really awesome, no falling off feeling.3. Used it continuesly for more than a hour, No pain in ears.4. Storage box is compact and beautiful and after placing earbuds inside the box it get fixed and on turning upside down also it is not falling off.5. Noise cancellation is awesome, opposite person is able to hear the voice clearly when speaking next to a high speed fan.Cons1. The left earpiece is not working properly while calls, maybe i have received a defective piece. Have raised replacement mentioning this issue. Hope the new one will not have this issue, fingers crossed. Shall update the review after receiving the replacement.2. The call quality while using it as monopod is little lesser than while used with both in use. Once again it may also due to diffective left earpiece. Shall update after checking it in replacement.3. Touch sensitive is too much sensitive, not able to adjust the earpiece while in an active call. Touching anywhere in the earpiece while in a call has cut the call most of the time. And on receiving the call, most of the time it was a challenge to keep the earpiece inside ear without cutting the call. I think it will take a while to master it.

FAKE product.. Poor from Amazon and boult. On reviews they said volume control are there but it doesn't. I returned one and they sent replaced item with same issue.Aftet 3s press on any bud it should be up/down volume but it take only one command and paly next/previous song.I have contacted customer care of boult and confirmed this product is having this volume control feature.Looks like amazon is selling different product on the name of this product.

 1. While playing online game ( pubg) I got a call, in answered and I spoke and was simultaneously playing the game as well but after the call was disconnected my Powerbuds did not connect back to the game and couldn't hear anything.2. The Powerbuds disconnect automatically and connect back, which happens very randomly.3. 10 minutes before a video call I was listening to music.While I was on the call I pressed the right powerbud but music started playing instead of disconnecting the call. That means there is a problem with the gesture4. As I opened the case the Powerbuds need to connect to my phone immediately but it's takes time to connect5. Powerbuds suddenly get disconnected even if it shows that the charge is full.6.on my redmi note 8 my AAC codec does not support.7. While calling someone while the call is ringing, suddenly you hear s cracking sound on both the Powerbuds.Kindly please help me out with these Powerbuds as I like the sound quality , hoping to hear from you guys @boultaudio, Thankyou.So when I just got my Airbass powerbuds . There was no problem in the connectivity . Once I open the case the bud used to connect to my phone and as I close the case they disconnected from my phone , which was nice .But now the buds stay connected to my phone even after closing the case . Which is affecting my notification sound and If I get a call I don't come to know .Please do something about this or give another product which is good or give me a refund.It's the second time I'm making a complaint regarding this product . In which the first time I exchanged it because of the connectivity and sound quality. And now it's the connectivity issue.

The product seemed used to me. I returned it. The next one I got was already 30-70% charged and one bud was fully charged while the other bud kept flashing slow blue light. I kept it on charge for a really long time and still it was the same story. Because the other bud wouldn't charge properly. I returned that as well.

The sound quality, bass, noise reduction is very nice...but what's the point of all that if the charging case just stops charging after the first discharge..Yes you heard it right, the charging case is not charging after it was discharged, and when i reached out to boult support team they are now asking me to ship my product all the way to Delhi!!!PLEASE DO NOT BUT THIS PRODUCT, BECAUSE IF IT TURNS OUT TO BE FAULTY LIKE MINE..YOU WILL HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE OTHER THAN SHIPPING IT TO DELHI ""ON YOUR OWN EXPENSE"".Really disappointed as after spending 2800 on the product, i even have to ship it myself to get it checked, no pick up from boult or anything.Worst customer support.I regret going with this device as for 2800, i only got to use them for less than a month and now to get it fixed i have to spend extra money to send it to delhi.Please consider this before buying this or any boult product, if it stops working or is faulty, you will have to send it to delhi.

There are many other brands with much lower price tags offering similar value. There is nothing special about th se ear buds. No noise cancellation, absolutely no bass (nothing different than my other ear phone which I got for abfew hundred rupees). The voice quality is pretty much average. Half the times folks at the other end cannot hear me. Just not worth th price I paid. The design and feel of the product is good though.
"

I got my product replaced because the first product the right ear buds were getting heatedAnd the replaced product was having a burning smell and would not even go to a shutdown mode even inside the box if you forget the audio in the play modeOtherwise the product is as committed by the company good quality material the sound is very good even it's good for calling and good for music even the latency is very lowI got both the placed order and the replaced product defect if not the product is good

At this price i guess these are quiet average.Sound quality is not at all good. I always feel the sound is suppressed. I had brainwavz blutooth earphones and they were much better in sound than these. Bass is good though. So its good for someome who just needs bass, but for those who seek clear and quality voice, dont go for these.Ergonomically these are good. Very light and after 1 minute you dont feel you have anything in your ears. Noise cancellation is also good.
"

It's very awful device. Its touch is very sensitive even if you are planning to rearrange the buds its causes alot of trouble. Very bad bluetooth connectivity with devices and sync between the buds.  Totally I would not suggest someone to buy these. Noise shots seems better as I bought it right after this
"
3031,"
Please don't buy it, if you are wishing to use for calls. The noice cancellation is so poor that the another person on the call is hearing the noice louder than the call voice. The service is also very poor, I haven't received any kind to service from boult after registering the complaint. So the warranty is just for name sake.Totally disappointed with the product.In case of connectivity and audio output the product is awesome. The sound quality is really good.Please help me to exchange the product, if anyone can.

This product isn't worth even a single star. They don't work well at all.Even if you buy this and this doesn't work , you guys have to send it all the way to Delhi. I bought this product for 2500 and extra 500 for sending the product twice to Delhi for repair. They never refund you , just replace it. Even for the first time I sent back to Amazon, I received defected. Later again I sent the product to head office in delhi again received defected. Finally Atlast after two months I got the right product. Please consider this when you buy.Also they make calls saying that they giveaway lucky draw for winners based on your positive reviews for the product. Please don't fall for it. Later they won't even lift our call if we ask about lucky draw. It's all drama.Finally, I suggest you guys not to buy it and reconsider yourself before buying it.

After buying the product, I got a call from the bolt office asking me to give a review and I will win a gift. The product was genuinely good at the beginning and then slowly the product after couple weeks started to work bad. I can’t take calls from the phone as the other side cant listen to me. Of late the pods get disconnected just out of the blue. I tried calling their customer care number, but it gets disconnected and I have no way to reach out to them.Was it a scheme to call the customer who bought to give good reviews showing them gifts when the product if not worth. I fell into the trap

I can say this tws buds are on of the best u can get on the budget of under 2500/-. It has surprisingly amazing noice cancellation, so u can get amazing call quality, also the base is good enough to satisfy yourself, now coming to the build quality , the plastic material capsule gives you quite premium looks , it's little bit bulky obviously for 2200mah massive capsule battery with powerbank facility. Honestly I don't know about gaming latency because I don't play games on phone, I'm a music lover and I can say this buds will not disappoint music lovers like me. Also it's good for calling , for those office workers , stuffs, online video callers etc. I'll give this product 4.5/5 rating.

A value for money product.Pros: Pairing is fast, Audio Quality is excellent like True HD, Bluetooth works great no issues, Can be used as monopod, Call quality is also very good, Can connect to 2 device simultaneously. Bass is perfect at this range. Battery usage is as shown can be used for 6 hours continuosly for calling and music. But if music is played on maximum value there can be a decrease of half an hour. Build quality of case and earpods a excellent. Touch function is is Good we can increase and decrease volume, skip track, pause, next track, previous track, call pickup and call disconnect and voice assistant easily with Just a little touch. Overall a good package much better than other products around this range. Finally I am satisfied this.

I bought this powerbuds after having an positive experience with my previously bought Boult wired earphones. Actually what I don't like About this earphones was it having some connectivity issues with pairing both the buds. Sometimes I had to force them to switch off then on to get them in pair so that I can connect to my phone and hear them both instead of 1 bud working in 1 ear. Apart from that my other issue is it's touch sensitive, which is you can pause,play,skip and answer calls without touching phone. Yes, the feature is great but it's not comfortable wearing them during lying on bed. It's super irritating when I switch sides to watch movies or listen to music it pauses or skips. Coming to good part the earphones fit perfectly in ears coming with 3 different buds sizes to choose from and noise cancellation is amazing. I can hear subtle noise only. Most of the outside noise disappears upon wearing them. The bass is adequate and ok. Nothing ground breaking. Sound quality and clarity is great. The charging pod is amazing. I only charged it once. It still supplying juice to powerup my earbuds which was housing on it . Over-all it's a nice experience for me to have this product. I would definitely recommend to my friends.

 Best product at this price range.Since, people looking for earpods at this range and compare with Boat 441 pro. But as far I compare both this Boult Audio Powerbuds standout from all the other products at this price range.Main feature is we can adjust volume which Boat 441 pro can't.Design of Boult Audio Powerbuds is cool. I choose the BLACK Colour. It's makes classy.Battery backup is awesome. I charge the case once in 2 weeks ( Buds get around 4.5 hr)It fits ear perfectly. Can do swimming, workout.It's touch control is awesome. But it pause even in a small touch. Because it get PAUSE accidentally. Which irritates me alot.Sound quality is GOOD.Noise cancellation is EXCELLENT. It plays songs perfectly even while we ride bike without Helmets.Call quality is OK. Because, while we are traveling in bike other person can't hear properly. But while we are in home or some other place which no wind it's fine.

Sound clarity and bass niceNoice cancellation okay onlyFit is comfortable. I having some problem with it namely1. The phone not disconnected from the earbuds even after I replaced it inside the box and closed the lid. The earbuds still connected and playing inside the box itself afer closing the lid2. The earbuds getting more heated wen it is kept inside the box in overnight and taken morning for regular use, it got heated like anything, and causing burns to ears3. Touch is not recognised often even though I touched in the touch area.4. Upper lid is very loose after little use itself

**It's a good product with clear sound and decent bass. It offers a good battery life, the buds gives around 6 hrs of total playback including gaming and streaming. The case also offers around 90hrs of battery. It takes around 3 hrs to get the case charged up completely. The noise cancellation is just ok but can't complain as all earbuds are like these.** The low latency on this is really promising, I played cod mobile and experienced jo lags in voice and even played pc games such as valorant and apex legends there too had no delays.** The device is really compatible and works good with Android phone and windows laptop but on the other hand if you are considering to buy this for an iPhone or a macbook I would not suggest this product as using these earbuds with iPhone or macbook the volume decreases by around 40-50% and there's definitely no bass.** To conclude if you're looking for a decent pair of earbuds for your android device with a great battery life for under 2.5k this could be a good option.

Worst products, they malfunction, battery nowhere near promised, disconnects continuously, can't answer calls, customer care is rude and they hang up the call, they don't provide warranty, they take 1 month to repair and replace and they again give you a even more faulty product covered in dust, oil and finger prints, the worst ever customer service who don't respond and got it replaced 3 times and all 3 times, they gave a faulty product, they don't reply to mails and hang up the calls. Boat is much much better.○ Static○ Stops stops working○ Disconnects continuosly○ Sound comes out even when connected○ Left ear bud doesn't get charged○ The charging disappears from the ear bud○ 3 dots to off○ 2 hours max per charging○ Suddenly increases n decreases sound○ Touch control only works for pause○ Low vol when connected to mobile○ Full charge lasts for upto 30 hours max○ Doesn't connect

I had High hopes from Boult. This is my third Product which I have got from them and let me be frank Audio quality is great. HOWEVER, I won't recommend this TWS for poor build quality. Within 15 days of purchase, the volume if right earbud has reduced by 50%. And the replacement policy is only for 7 days so now Company is not liable for any kind of fix/replacement.If you just want to use this product for 5-10 days, buy it. Else steer clear of it as ₹2000 will be better spent elsewhere.

I  bought it on 3rd March 2021 charged it only once it's 12th March today and it's still showing battery full i.e (all 3 indicators of battery).I used it  regularly for 4 to 6 hours at max.Once I used roughly 5 and half to 6 hours at a stretch after that it said low battery when it is at  20% then  it lasted for other 15 -20 minutes when it came down to under 10 % or so,i haven't observed the charge time but it's fast may be in an hour or so using battery case.when pods are connected and pods are having low battery it plays an audio mentioning it.It says We can use it in 2 phones as they act as master and slave I haven't tried that but it's true as I turned off one pod and used other one many times.I bought if for online class purpose and movie watching It serves my purpose well.regarding extra bass etc,sound quality I am not much interested in them it's upto the user.Call quality is good,I tried only in indoors.I needed a decent battery and durable product I got it.touch sensitivity is smooth and  light indicators are good.It fits well in our ears.Compared to other brands and their price ranges its much ahead of all when comes to battery.Cons: we don't know whether battery case  is charged fully or not, it took 7 - 9 hours when I charged it for the first time.,the third led indicators kept glowing for long hours (i.e it says battery is charging from 70% to 100%).it's mentioning while charging if  leds stop blinking it's fully charged.they could have given a option/indicator for that in the phone/battery case,I could only get earpods battery level but not the charge case battery level.Touch sensitivity is a bit more it might pose a little bit problem for first time users.We will feel little bit discomfort after using it for longer duration I.e it's ok for movie watching but not for online study purposes.

The noise cancellation is great. The product finish is good. Looks great by appearance. The sound quality is also quite good at this price. The mic is given on both the buds and works perfectly fine and calls can be easily attended and the quality of voice in calls is also great. Sounds like a normal call through phone's mic. The Bluetooth strength is strong and if I connect the buds with my laptop, I am able to hear the songs being played on laptop kept at 10-15 m from me.

Hello friends, please consider my genunine feedback for this earbud. I m using from last one week. The Sound quality I found is good.

Extremely uncomfortable to my ears & gives pain. I would suggest not to buy.

This piece was delivered to me 2 days back. In this COVID scenario,I had waited for a day to open the package. The next day when I opened the package, they worked for sometime before their battery became low. After charging the case, when I put the buds for charging into, it has been another day, the right bud is neither getting charged not getting switched on.So now I have applied for exchange, though as I have lost the trust on the product, I wish , they could return it. One has to struggle with it's Mic as well.Very disappointing.

The device however lacks some basic indicative directions like it doesnt have led illumination to tell you if the case is fully charged or buds are fully charged . I have had issues with sudden pairing fails with the left and right ear pods and struggled to get it going until i reset it . Reseting it also was a laborious task. The manual asks you to press the ear pods while they are in the charging case and rarely do these work . It was a struggle and irritation that was the result overall . Taking the pods outside the charging case will be a struggle too as they are slippery and bound to fall off while trying to pick them up from the casing.However ,Basically these are good ear pods  in  terms of performance of sound reproduction . though it says powerbass , it lacks the punch . However stereo clarity is good and can suit for daily phonecalls and listening to music . Please dont even compare these pods with the superior ones in the market . They just dont stand the chance but net net do the job .

Having used the product for almost an year and seen the entire customer service aspect. Here are the things I liked and disliked about the product.I used these extensively for almost an hour everyday.Pros1. Great service delivery2. Good battery backup3. Sound quality with bass is nice may be not great for an audiophileCons.1. The powerbuds started showing trouble related to charging after 6 months. Eventually conked off post 9 months2. That's where you start the follow-ups with the customer service which showed promise first with their proactiveness3. But then again once I returned the item for a replacement there was no communication and I had followup with them for well over a monthI would suggest if you are in a metro like mumbai bangalore getting BOAT audio might be a better thing to do as they have their service centers which are pretty neat and proactive.

Frankly speaking the product is good. Good bass, tuned precisely to hear well balanced audio for movies and songs. Fits in ear well during my long runs and had good clarity on voice call.Cons,1. Well the touch button sensitivity, like when you running or driving and you simply try to adjust it either the voice call her disconnected or it pauses the songs. I always made sure it is in proper place before answering the call or else the call gets disconnected with the slightest touch.2. No option for customization the tapping function.

Bought on offer @ ₹1,999.Relax though, these may not be the best of the audio quality you could get, but at his price, it just could be.1. Audio is above average. Bass is on the average.2. Great boxing. Everything's neatly packed and feels premium enough.3. Connectivity is good. The earbuds get connected to the phone (if Bluetooth is already turned on) even as the charging case is opened. Though, if you're connecting it while they're plugged in to the ears, or reconnecting, a beep and the message saying it is connected is pretty high in volume even if you have lowered the volume on the phone.4. The part of the earbuds with the brand sign is touch-sensitive and you can play or pause with a single touch. But it is a disadvantage at times e.g. when you try to hold around the earbuds to place it inside your ears without touching the sensitive area and the earbuds beats you to it and the respective command (play/pause-whatever) activates. It is also a discomfort when you might touch it twice to play because the latency (which is negligible during music play but significant with play control) makes you do so as the audio will start or stop with a delay after the touch command.5. The battery backup life of the earbuds themselves isn't great. The charging case, however, is a good batterybank. Stays for days to use.  The battery charge remaining on the earphones in percentage is shown on the phone's Bluetooth screen in denominations of 10 (100%, 90%, 80% etc). Since one will be carrying the case along for resting the headphones while not in use will magnetically pull the buds well into place and start charging right away. The case itself has a magnetic open/close lid. It feels like a little jewel box :D6. The placement inside the ears is comfortable but make sure you have plugged em in tight enough, failing which will end up losing the buds as is the case with any true wireless weeny buds anyway.7. The IPX7 has not been tested for the purpose yet. Although a bud once fell into watery dirty mud but worked fine after cleaning dry with tissues soaked with water followed by sanitiser.

Great product for listening to music or making calls from mobile. However, not recommended if you are looking for a product to connect to laptop for conference calls or Web conferences. Bass is okiesh. Battery life is awesome. I forget when I had charged the last time. Using for 2 to 3 hours daily, after 2 weeks, I see full charge. No issue with built quality or fitting on my ears. Can use for long hours. A small drawback is the touch being very sensitive, you may accidentally disconnect or pause video / music. But you will soon find it to handle properly. Recommended product.

No doubt it's Best earbuds. Bass is very good but not as the wired earphones, obviously because it has small drivers than wired earphones because of room size. Sound quality also very good, you can hear all notes. Battery backup is too good, i use them more than a week with normal usage in 1 full charge. I have only 1 problem with this I can't use this with helmet because of when I am in a call then suddenly helmet touches earbud and cuts the call, and also while listening song then helmet touches earbud and next or previous song plays. I hate this thing. Noise cancellation is bad, you can't use this on traffic or crowded place but it's ok because mic is too far. After all everything really good.

Hi ,This lokesh reviewing after two weeks, what a beautiful beast this is.. a pure punchy loud true wireless earbuds.. i am writing some valid point after using it and friends dont go with rumors, my purchase is valid, you can see it, its verified by amazon and superfast 1 day delivery..Pros :1. Pure punchy bass, if you are bass lover you will definitely fall in love with this buds2. Lightweight, yes it is quite big but not heavy in weight3. Too much loud, much more louder than galaxy buds+ as i have listened buds+ from one of my friend4. No sound break even in full volume5. Good battery life, i think no one is going to use it for long 24 hours continuously.Charging was done five days still it's working with 40%I am really missing the headphone connects ,but its ok because the sound i am getting from this buds are really awesome..An update :Some people are complaining about sound depth, please change the eartips from small to medium or large, you will understand the changes and will get the real sound.Thank you Boult and Amazon

I have bought 3 times this piece of crap, every time the same problems1. Voice distortion in videos2. Abnormal behaviour of buds3. Charging problem is buds, even after leaving the buds for whole day in charging case buds sometimes don't get charged4. Pathetic customer care service. They just fool you to change the review swearing they have put your case on 1st priority list. Once you get fooled they never resolve your problem.Unfortunately I have passed the returned date and will have to bear with these problems forever. My suggestion is, go for more trusted brand even if you find few of the features missing that this piece of crap offers.

This is a detailed review and I like the product, but had to return it due to the reasons mentioned in cons.Cons:1. The major drawback is that the play/pause button doesn't work on single tap and does not consistently work, so it gets really very irritating and inconvenient.The call quality of this product is not good when compared to similar products and the other person is sometimes not able to clearly here what you are saying.Pros:Both earpods can work as monopods as well, so  you have two monopods that you can use with two different mobiles at the same time. This is not available in some comparable products.The range of bluetooth is greater. Also there is almost no lag even at greater Bluetooth distances when compared to other similar products.The sound and bass for music is good. The earpods fit well and that enhances the sound.To sumup, the price(1,799) is very very competitive when compared to other products of the same specifications, almost half. But the touch buttons is where the problem lies.If you are okay with that go ahead, this is a good product at a great price, except the inconvenience caused due to the buttons and call quality.

I have tried many brands, but this one satisfied my expectations. Very sensitive touch control and mic and call quality is reasonably OK. The battery power is amazing! You can go on for a week without recharging. The case body build should be little more stronger to avoid lid breaking problem. The buds are ergonomically designed and never caused any pain or discomfort to my ears. The voice quality is better than wired ear phone. I have MI, JBL, INFINITY AND Airpods also, the sound quality is better than all other brands mentioned above but Airpods. Value for money, you can give a try.

1. BATTERY - Tremendous battery backup. Using since 2nd Feb 2021. Today is 7th Feb 2021. 5hrs every day. The case is still showing 3 LEDs. Will try to update later.2. SOUND QUALITY - Considering a pair of TWS for just Rs.2200, the sound quality is okay. Lack of clarity if you compare to a similarly priced wired earphones. Not suggested for musicians as your primary device.3. BASS - Bass is decent if you use the largest rubber eartips.4. TREBLE - seems okay. Not much distortions at full volume. Tested with Metal music (Dream Theatre+Metallica)5. COMFORT - A bit bigger than I expected as I have small ears. Needs a bit of adjustment & time to find the right angle of fit. Please use the correct ear tip.6. TOUCH - The sensors are very sensitive. A bit too sensitive for me. Not sure about others. Many may find out perfect. It will get triggered even if you only try to adjust the buds.7. BUILT QUALITY - Except the case hinge, everything is built really well. The hinge has a very slight give.8. LOOKS - Looks really good at this price point. I love the buds. One issue - the case colour (black) finish has small blotches on it if you look closely at my pics.9. COMPACTNESS - As it has a 2200mah battery, the case is a bit too big for your pocket. It will never fit into the watch pocket of your jeans.10. MICROPHONE - Okay for calls. Worthless for video calls via Windows PC. No noise cancellation.11. BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY - Works well upto 10 meters for music. For calls, starts breaking up before 10 meters. Feedback on 13th October 2021 - Buds are sometimes not getting disconnected after placing them back inside the case and closing there lid. I've reset them many times. There seems to be some pin contact issue with the case. Same thing happens with my Boult Freepods.

I have Apple Airpods and thought to buy it for my wife .As the price was too low I thought it will be nice to have another Airpods but the biggest problem is connectivity.The whole purpose of having Airpods get lost.Even though I remove it from my ear the Airpods go on.Even though I put it in the charger box but still it's connected to my device which actually shouldn't be.Buy blue tooth headphones of Boat.Those are more useful than this.

Boult Audio is one of the best Bluetooth earbuds, which I recently bought from Amazon's website, at that time Amazon's sale was also going on, in which I got it at very low prices. I was also thinking of buying a best bluetooth device for many days and finally I bought this device from Bolt, after using it for about a month, I have come to the conclusion that the product I have bought is the best product in itself  . Its sound quality is excellent.  Noise cancellation is also very good, apart from the above, I got to see more great features in this,  like:  It has extra bass, inbuilt mic which proves to be effective in making videos.  Apart from this, Siri / Google Assistant is also a great feature in this, through which we can search many things, and everything is touch control. Personally I have liked this device very much and if you get this device at a low price then definitely buy and use I am sure that you will also get satisfaction..

Using this product for over an year now. If you are looking for balanced bass pod, go for it. But ""HIGHLY"" recommended dont go for calling purpose, WORST experience. Zero cancellation.Still I was loving the product but slowly and steadily issues came. First there was frequent disconnection with the mobile or anyother device. Which after some time got resolved. Then after few months one of the airpod completely stopped working, which got replaced within a week that too home pick up and drop service. Which is commendable. But that too gave up after 4/5 months. Now my one side pod is not working. I dont know if I am that unlucky one or Boult product is like that. Overall rating:Bass : 4/5Calling : -2/5Design: 3.5/5Connectivity: 2.5/5Battery Backup: 10/5

Product really works as expected. This is my first TWS and this is my short review after using it for almost half a month,Fit: This mainly depends on your ears. For me my right ear starts paining after using it for 3 to 4 hrs at a stretch, but for left ear the fit is awesome.Sound: Clear crisp sound even at loud sound. Could easily listen to music or movies at 50 per sound.Bass: Bass is appropriate and it depends on how it fits your ears. But if you want heavy bass then this is not for you.Battery: No doubt in it. I have charged it fully 14 days back and still it shows all 3 indicator while charging. My usage is almost 2 to 3 hrs per day. Also i have uaed it around 4 hrs at a stretch at 60 per volume and the battery in earbuds was showing 60per which is really greatQuality: Case is mild heavy due to battery size but it does not matter for me. The lid seems to be little weak, outer matte finish could be little more premium. But overall it is good case for the price.Connectivity: Super quick if they are already paired and you are trying to reconnect again. If you have uaed it with other device it may take some time or you have to manually select the device, but thats normal for all the devices.Delivery: on first attempt i received the seal broken case and so raised return request which got fulfilled in couple of days and then received the new branded box.So far this is my review.. will update upon usage.Update: Decreasing 1 star as I am not happy with the customer care services. For getting higher starts, I used to get calls on the status of product, it is working fine and even I was asked to give early feedback for cashback rewards. Once I shared them that i have given the feedback on Amazon, No response from the team. Even i did not get any cashback, but now they are even not responding to my messages on their business numbers.

I dont know if the manufacturer has tested it or not but its a total disappoint. Not a product you should prefer to talk through. Your voice doesn't reach to the receiver end.  Its microphone is upwards & ur voice doesn't reach to it while you normally speak.I hv got it replaced with another one but the result is the same.Grossly disappointed & absolutely NOT RECOMMEND this to anyone.Pls do not buy this & fall trap like me. Now neither i can through this nor i can use this.Still anyone making mind to buy this product, pls connect me...i wl give mine at half cost. Hardly used. I can't even return this product.

It stopped working after a month of purchasing as it was in the warranty I registered a complain and it took Boult Audio over a month to register the compain and another month to pick up the product from my residence and when I finally recieved the repaired product not the replacement it was badly scratched and dented.Again after 2 days it stopped working and I reached to their customer executive she was very rude and told me to courier the product back. Yes they didn't arranged the pick up as well. I couriered the product and I was promised by both Amazon and Boult Audio that this time I will get the replacement meaning the new product not the repaired one as they have already dented and scratched the body but when I again received it for the 2nd time in a row it was the same repaired product with more scraches and the battery panel is very loose that it won't go back in its original position.

Guys don't buy please believe me, I know that bass is good, environmental noise cancellation is also good sound quality is also decent but most important thing is that they are very uncomfortable to wear believe me guys it is very very very uncomfortable, your ears will start paining after wearing for half on hour...... Comfort is first priority. If you will not feel comfortable after wearing then all the other features are futile......please don't buy. I don't want you all to regret later....... And if you ask me honestly All the other reviews which are good are written the excitement of the new earphones ( lol 😃) And Also I have been using the since 3 months now. Its touch is very sensitive even and believe me it is its minus point because even if you will touch them to get a perfect fit the song will start or stop whatever and also now these stop in midway while the song is playing and goes mute in the midway and then after 5 sec. Plays again. Very bad. Very very very bad...

Genuine review after 6 months of usage:-I have realized my mistake, I gave it 3 stars before but it didn't even deserve 1 star, these earbuds are useless. It took only about 5 months for them to malfunction.One of the earbuds doesn't work anymore.I sent them for claiming warranty also but they didn't repaired it well and it still switch off on its own while hearing to music.Worst product, worst services.I regret a lot for trying boult audio my first time, never gonna buy another boult audio product anymore.

Pathetic product.  One of the earbud(left one)  is not working. Initially I thought it might be pairing issue so I didn't return it but later on I found that the left earbud itself is defective. And now I have to courier it all the way to new delhi.  They do not have any other service center any where.  I spent a good Rs. 2700+ on this.  Very disappointed

Product quality is very good. Sound quality is also reasonable at this price. Best range is 5m and max 10 m. I can pair and use single bud also. It's perfect fit in the ear. Make sure the direction and ear side L or R is proper when you insert in the ear, it will fit perfectly and will not drop while you workout.Initially I got little confused with configuration but after watching instruction in you tube, got clarity and I am loving it now.Thank to boult

My first earbuds and I'm happy with them.Good value price and a breeze to set up.They paired with my phone and I was impressed with the sound, I used them in a cab, on a bus and in the gym.I'm happy with their ability to block out the world, I wouldn't wear them on the streets, I'd probably get run over!I like how they glow when they are charging.My only gripe is that they are a bit fiddly to remove from the case, could have had a little texture around the body of the earbuds for my fat fingers to grip on to.Let's hope they last.

The product is absolutely fine. But plese DO NOT BUY If you want to live in peace after that. The customer service representatives contact you on whatsapp and call , asking you to provide a review. They also influence you to write a good review and send them a screenshot. They keep contacting you everyday and continuously pester you with calls and messages over SMS and WhatsApp. Even in spite of clearly telling them to politely stay away, they WILL NOT LEAVE you alone. If anyone would want the proof, I have the ENTIRE conversation. PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS BRAND IF YOU WANT SOME PEACE OF MIND. HORRIFIC MARKETING TEAM.

I have received this product yesterday. what I am gonna review about this product its has nice battery backup as I am getting upto 6 hours per single charge.This device need to be improved in sound quality as it delivers low sound compared to boat .Bass is also not upto the mark .Overall we can go for this earbuds if we want to have nice battery backup.

I am writing this review after 2 months of use, the airpods not working properly,no sync happened between 2 sides of ear pods,since its in warranty period,Boult support team asked me to send the product, again courier cost I have to bear, I got the confirmation message that they received and they suppose to send back the item within 48hrs but now 5days passed no response from them, they're not even responding to mail. I can see many feedback,same issues with many people.

For starters the build quality is poor. The hinge feels loose and flimsy, you get the feeling that it may brake or fall of fairly easily.The build quality of the earphones itself isn’t bad, but it’s nothing special.While the packaging and unboxing experiences are okay, the instructions are very poorly written.Now to the main part, the sound quality of the earphones themselves. They are simply mediocre at best. While the audio itself is clear, the audio itself lacks depth and the bass lacks punch.The only thing I actually like about these earphones is the mic for phone calls. People on the other end of the line can hear me loud and clear.In all honesty but something from Boat if you want the most bang for your buck. Their build quality, attention to detail and overall sound quality is noticeably better for offerings in the same price range.

This is second product from Boult and expectation was high. First of all received defective product one of the bud is not charging even after hours and switches off in 2 mins as low battery. Replacement ordered but it took longer to arrive. Secondly, it wouldn't reach the sound level expectations claims as sound is moderate quality, even volume cannot reach your expectations let alone bass.Overall - Too high claim but under delivered! I still gave it 3 star.

Do not buy it even if they give it for 100 rupees . Very bad product.  I think there is some kind of software problem with it , sometimes one side stops working and sometimes both or one gets discharged quickly.  I've bought two different models of boult earbuds and both of them have same problem . I sent it for repair 3 times but issue wasn't solved. And also the service is very bad and takes almost one month for getting the product back. you have to send the product to them with your own money for warranty claim . So I would suggest not to buy any of the boult earbuds .Did not work properly even for a single day . I had bought 3 different boult earbuds , and none of them works properly . Sent each of them to service center 3 times to get repaired but it didn't work . Problems 1 ) one of the earbuds stops working 2 ) sometimes both of them stops working 3 ) sometimes both are connected but couldn't hear anything 4 ) even after charging they say "" battery low "" 5 ) case gets too hot And many other problems So I would suggest not to buy any of the boult earphones .

The product is working fine, all the features promised are fulfilled by it.The only drawbacks I found were :1) in pairing, which may require some patience sometimes and 2)in the earbuds provided with it which are quite tough (# durability ensured). If you plug them tightly, your ear's bones might ache but if you don't, they may fall off easily. Even when you don't move around, they tend to loose up and fall down. If you use a softer earbud, this problem might get resolved.PS: May be people with big earholes might not face this issue

I bought this for my wife thinking Boult would give quality sound output. I found EdYell better which I'm using.Boult has limited Tapping usable features like stop and play music, receive and disconnect call and power off.Surprisingly power off does not work while it is connected to Bluetooth device. It works only when disconnected.Whereas EdYell also gives volume up/down feature. I can also power off while connected with device.

Poor noise cancelation and sound echo, you will your own voice echoing back...not recommended for office meetings because everyone complains echo when you unite yourself...Seems like both the earbuds are not in sync and act like 2 different devices...Some how I managed the calls in mono mode with one earbud only , until I got my Sony bluetooth headphones which are really good for office meeting.

Starting with the build Quality : It looks premium., Can't deny on this.Battery Life : Very Good so far.Noise cancellation: You can hear only your clear voice and feel like the other person on the call could hear as well. But let me tell you, the person on the other side can't hear anything. There is no logic spending Rs 2500 for the earbuds. Main motive of buying is to make calls and this earbuds doesn't justify the purpose. I would definitely give 1 star for voice quality.

Won't last a year mine died in 8 months repeated mails to customer service matter not resolved. Don't buy guy if ur looking for 1-2 yr use. Customer service will make u take a vow not to buy Boult product for life. Its decent in sound good in looks but main problem is its size. Its slightly bigger than other devices so touches the inside of the ears and after some time discomfort and slight pain starts. Voice while attending phone also echos. Over phone u have to remove/disconnect it as other person can hardly listen to ur voice clearly. Had there been refund option would have returned it without thinking for a sec. The blinking Led makes u a laughing stock if ur a midage adult. My advice is a big NO to Boult products

I would recommend everyone to never buy this product even if they sell it for free I am so frustrated while writing this review first of all the product just sucks mic isn't working properly the bass is not there the battery power promised is not there and THE BUDS NEVER SEEM TO SYNC AND CHARGE!!!! even when I leave them for 3-4 hours the sound is annoying and the touch refused to work after  a week it will disconnect randomly and proceeds to produce a loung thumping sound like it would blast and then gets connected againm The customer care service is very bad and rude and they will force you to give 5 strars in exchange of fast response on there side if the product gets damaged that's why there is 5 star reviews in all honesty don't trust it this sucks just like the company!!!!

21/08/21 - Read this to understand how Boult is able to get good rating on Amazon by getting the genuine poor ratings deleted.Boult customer service reaching NEW LOWSTwo weeks back I got a call from Mehul stating he is calling from Boult Head office for the product issue and promised to give a replacement in exchange for me deleting the review on Amazon. I did not how how to delete it then so I ended up editing to an empty review.Luckily the review did not get deleted. Fast forward two weeks his number is coming switched off and no replacement for the faulty product.Today I got a call again Atul (now he is also from head office and claims there is no Mehul in head office). He makes a similar request but this time I refused to delete the review so guess what did he say, they cannot give me customer service if the review is not deleted first!!!I am sharing my experience so others don't fall prey to such Boult cons. They only make big talks.So my humble request to you1. Don't buys Boult2. In case you have or still plan to be aware of such tactics by themIt could be the seller too calling me.----------------------------------------------------Updating my review after few months of use.The ear pods have stopped working and their customer service is poor.

I'm going to list the pros and cons of the product but overall I think it was a good experience but read the pros and cons to understand further.Pros:- The sound quality is good.- The backup is amazing. It has been nearly two months I guess but I have charged the case only once.Cons:- The lid of the case is a little fragile as others mentioned but I did not see any problem because of this.- I don't know how the charge and discharge cycle would be for the earbuds. If I use the earbud for like 20% charge and place it back in the case, it will chargeback. If I keep doing like this and charge only the used 20%, I'm not sure if the battery life would be good or not as we are not doing full discharge and full recharge. There should have been a switch in the case to enable or disable the charging of buds.- I felt that the product is a little heavy on my ears. After using it for like 2 or 3 hours continuously, I get the urge to take it out of my ear. It is not at all comfortable.- The volume adjustment I do on the mobile device or laptop sometimes doesn't take effect. I have suffered to find other ways to reduce the volume. I still don't know how it works. This part is inconsistent.

Bought this headphone in January. Since the start itself there were bluetooth connectivity issues with Windows Laptop and could only pair with Android phone. Both left and right earpod themselves would not pair half the time and either one of them would be off. After 2 months right earpod would not charge sometimes after keeping in case. And after 5-6 months this right earpod now has stopped charging always no matter how many times you put it back in case.This is the worst electronic product I have ever bought and highly advise everyone to stay away from Boult brand

I have just purchased this product before 15 days and writing review after sufficient testing. I would like to mention that battery backup is awesome. I have charged earbuds case once or twice in 15 days. Even noice cancellation is good.Now every product came with several drawbacks also, I would like to mention some drawbacks also.This product is not easily getting connected with laptop and if somehow you are able to connect then it get confuse with Headset and Headphone drivers. After 2 minutes, the random issues like disturbing noise, no audio audible at other end, and even connecting next time is not getting easy.So I would like to tell all of you that this product is good with phones but need some improvement when it comes to laptop connectivity.I hope Boult Audio team would take this feedback as genuine and do some improvement to server better.

Very poor quality. Earbuds sound is very low. I have purchased this earbuds before. This is a duplicate version earbuds. Earbuds box is not even charging. I placed a replacement order but delivery guy didn't even came. I contacted him 2 times that day but he said he will deliver my package on nexy day citing he received many packages as it was festive season. To my shock next day, amazon App shows I rejected the package but in reality delivery guy didn't came to my house next day. I tried to contact him but the extension number was given to other delivery guy next day. Very bad experience. I wasted my money.

Decided to buy this instead of Boat, as I already have a Boat headphone. These Boult Audio earbuds didn't disappoint! Crystal clear audio and very good bass! Good size, neat looks and fits comfortably in ears. The only thing I would say it will be nice to have different color variants on these earbuds. Using it for just two days now and still trying to figure out the touch controls. Comes with fast type C charger and extra ear buds. Very happy with the buy. Thanks to Amazon for the super fast delivery as usual.

I thought this is the brand of earbuds I'm looking for. But 100% disappointed. While I riding in bike and listening to songs, there is quite frequent latency issue is seen. Song suddenly stops in one of the earbuds and in a delay of few seconds, it started to play in 2x fast mode to match the duration of the song. In calling: Callee cannot hear me properly in my normal voice. I've to shout to make them hear. Quality is very bad and this product doesn't even deserve for 1 star since earbuds we are using only for calling and listening to music. But both quality is worst. Do go for this product if you want waste your money.

I ordered it once and then got it replaced as well. Both the first product delivered as well as the replacement will not work beyond 5 mins (I left it to charge 3-4 hours as well as overnight the second time). I don't know if this is because the product delivered is fake or if the original is of such poor quality. There is no sound quality or noise cancellation either and I can practically hear everything around me. This is a serious issue because both the times I ordered and replaced I faced the same issue with the product. If you still want to give it a go I recommend that you purchase directly with the brand and not from here.

I took my time to check so many YouTube videos on truly wireless earphones, these are the best in mid-range.They are beyond my expectations, better than even the reviews.I love the fact it has a massive battery backup, doesn't need charge, I've used moderately for a week now and only charged once.Charges quickly,Pairs so fast that the moment you open the case you are connected to the phone, even connectivity with laptop was quite good.Another pro is that it is sleek looking, comfortable to my ear, also has spare ear cushion accessories to suit everyone's ear size.Another thing worth a mention is the passive noise cancelation is bomb and has decent bass.I also like the ip7 rating, can workout with them, brush my teeth wash my face, can easily tolerate little moisture.I can't believe boult has given everything in such a good price point.

First of all, the pack  clearly says 120 hrs. Why does Amazon claim 155 hrs ??? Misleading their customers!They were good until they were working. After the first charge, which was after around 15 days, the battery started draining out in less than an hour. And also the sound got distorted after connecting to laptop, specifically. Hopefully, will get a better one after exchange.Edit: Got a black ones this time. But they are working great with huge battery back up.

I’m enjoying every bit of sound from Airbass Powerbuds. The only disadvantage I noticed is when it’s connected to my iPhone it keeps connecting and disconnecting when music is off. Otherwise it’s connected without any latency. Also, voice call is not that clear and it has a latency issues while talking or listening over a telephone network.

1. Sound Quality - Good Hearing. Clear Voice.2. Bass Quality - Slightly sub-standard. Although good but not very effective. Not good for music listening but can watch movies.3. Noise cancellation - Good. The other person can also hear clear voice.4. Bluetooth - Good connectivity. The claim realises good.

 Pretty good - it will be worth the price because sound quality is quite good and battery life ke kya kehne.... u can charge your phone from the buds charger , it has so much power. It’s a premium product being offered at reasonable  price of 2200/- .I give it 4 stars because if i compare it with the expensive earbuds (apple/ sony) , it’s bass is not as great.

Update: its been 5 months, and starting to see alot random disconnects between the buds and the devices they are connected to... Sometimes, it wont even switch on and off as shown by the manual,  i will have to return the buds to the case, then only they connect again. Definitely a damper on the overall experience.Mic quality is sub par. Depending on your surroundings, it may also cause an echo Dropped these in water.... Never doubting the IP rating ever again, its been a week and they are still working just as brand newFor someone who uses this frequently, the battery life is the biggest contributor to my rating.Great product! Slight lag during gaming, but for music, watching videos or calls it works flawlessly.

Very very disappointed. Very bad purchase. Suddenly after 19 days left earbud is not working. Chased customer service center badly. Helpless service. Spent another 600 rs for sending back to customer center in Noida. So my spent is 2500 plus 600 and no return product available after 2 months. Eventually bought boat 441 pro very superior than this. Loss of money, time and efforts

2nd day review.its stands up to my mark.I ordered it for my running.it didn't fall off.👍👍it connects quickly. it's a master master reabuds.ipx7 waterproof. 5/5 for that.Still now no technical issues.will be updating on the same if i get some issues.buy this without hesitating.Day 106 review :Today is jan 20. i ordered it on 6th October.now its battery is totally drained out with 70 still left in.on an average I listen song for 30 minutes per day. so it lasts approx 53 hours. which is approx 1/3rd of actual mentioned duration.again saying, don't doubt just go for it.🙏

I have used 2 of BOULT products, both are working good.Initially i had bought Boult over the neck Bluetooth earphone, liked by it's performance i decided to go for this product.I was a bit skeptical about the Mic. But it did not disappoint me. I attend all my office calls on mobile and laptop using these pods, they work the best.Sound quality is also not bad.Pairing and connecting is butter smooth, only that it takes you a while to understand the process.Cons: Only thing i felt a bit irritating is the touch actions, sometimes you don't get it right.

Bought these after watching igyaan s recommendation but very disappointed after using it. It does have bass but you can barely enjoy it as their sound output is really low. Its good for watching movies or videos in a closed environment but Music and that too outdoors is Big No. And disconnecting is a task it does not gets off once you put them back in the case . Don’t buy this product .

Sound is good. Nice bass. Battery lasts really long too but i did not enjoy them at all for cycling (i bought them only for cycling). If you just wipe your face and accidentally touch the side even slightly the button gets pressed, often voice command gets activated and it starts calling someone random.  If you take them off and store so irritating two small earbuds if it slips from your hand while on the road you may loose it and once the power goes off and you don’t have the case i dont know how to restart and pair both again only one starts. So you should always carry the case which can be used as a power bank but inly very small <500mAh charge.Basically i found this fully wireless style is not good for sports like cycling or running. Just get the ones with a wire around the neck with push buttons they are less complicated and so convenient.If you want to use them for music while indoors, travelling or at the gym then they are good sound quality but mic is not great call quality is just ok but good enough. They are comfortable, fit well never felt like they would fall from the ears.

This product has some flaws like:1. Accessing google assistance is some what difficult as the tap gesture for access GA is 3sec and for forward is 2sec. So the time comflicts occurs.2. Starting it's working good but after one month of use, it' s giving problem in connecting with laptop.Sometime it will connect only one earbud not both. Then again I've disconnect and then again connect , then it will work.3. The autoconnect function is not working properly after one month of use.Other things are good. I'll say don't buy this. Instead u can go to others product.

The battery is great I think I have charged only twice in last 4 months , on an average I use it for 2-3 hours a day or even more during weekends so battery is just awesome.Coming to comfort, it's not very comfortable to use as ears start paining after using for sometime. Feels heavy on ears.That blue light on the earphones should be removed as at night time it's very disturbing for someone sleeping beside you.Overall OK product. If The above mentioned things are taken care it's will be the best one at this price.Thanks

We are using this product from last 3 weeks and what we felt is its a budget product. We are happy to own this everything abt voice is decent very synchronized sound not only bass a vocal also clear in that!  Only sound we expected wow we dint get it.  So overall good built qualities we got additional ear buds so we can adjust accordingly  our ear canal. Indeed noise cancellation is good if we wear buds accordingly our ear canal!.

I have used a LOT of headphones in the last two years. For my work I use a wired Jabra Evolve 40, a wireless Jabra Talk 45 which is a mono, a Jabra Elite 65t and for music and for gaming or movies a Razer Kraken. Now I know I cannot compare these products with each other, but if I had to go with one for all round usage minus meetings/calls, it would be Boult Audio Air bass Power Buds. Having spent so much on other wireless devices, I really don't see that there is any relevance to spending a lot on earbuds unless you're too particular about your music quality or you want a great mic with noise cancellation for calls. For calls, I really don't think wireless earbuds are a smart buy. Buy a Bluetooth mono headset or wireless calling headset. Trust me, go ahead with this. No questions asked!A couple of things that make this irreplaceable are:- The battery. You just cannot find an alternate. The power buds and the case lasted me a 4 day trip without ever charging when in meetings for 4-5 hours a day! Sometimes I forget how many days have gone by since I charged the case. And the earbuds on themselves do last more than 10-12 hours. I am only guessing because I don't remember. In the last 1 year there was never a time that I had to put them back in the case because the battery died.- Each of the two connects individually to the phone, unlike my Jabra 65T. You can use one of them in an ear, or both of them together, or share one with another person. Unlike some other earbuds, they don't need to be together to work since one earbud is primary and the other is secondary.- USB Type C: This may not be relevant for everyone but since my phone too uses a USB Type C, its easier to manage not having to find another cable to charge.- Durable: I have dropped it many times, to be honest. Its pretty sturdy.CONS:- Its not noise cancelling. But you cant expect that for this price range.- Not the best product for calling, unless you're in a silent room and talking at normal volume. You wont get the best call quality if talking softly or if other noises are around.- Will connect to one device at a time. But again, you cannot expect support for multiple devices at the same time at this price range.

Within 15 mins i placed refund such a worst experience. Not at all comfortable in ears it goes deep inside the ear it feels like it touches the eardrum , tested for audio calls and on other end they felt lots of noise and discomfort. And music experience is very poor and bulky earpods and charging case are again minus points . Pls dont waste time money on these worst pods

It was delivered on 14th August and it was fully charged when it was delivered.. And I re-charged the charging case only on 31st of August for the first time after delivery. And, I used the ear buds almost everyday for at least 2-3 hours, whether it is music or audio book or movie or YouTube videos or even calls, so it gave me more than 30 hours roughly, Which is good.. But on the box, I don't understand what does it mean 120 hours play time. If it's a print mistake, they must correct it.. I will try and test it more.Apart from that, its really good quality. Better and best than lots of so called branded ear buds.. And the quality is equally challenging other big brands.

I'm writing this review after 5th day of using this Pro bass earbuds of Boult Audio ....and I have to say...it's pretty Amazing. 1st of all I'm very thankful for the BATTERY BACKUP, I never thought the earbuds would have this much backup. After charging for full ( which only takes 1.5 hours !! ) , I'm able to use again for upto 6 hours ( using both earbuds together ). Also as mentioned in description, these 2 earbuds can also be used individually. About the SOUND QUALITY, it's almost perfect, I mean I'm very happy. The music's etc even on high quality audio and gaming, the audio is very clear ( U guys should tryout ASMR videos with these in full volume !  Simply Amazing). NOISE CANCELLATION is also great. There is 3 more earbud sizes included in packet ( small, medium,big) so cancellation is great too.  & Earbuds are comfortable too. It will also survive even after accidentally fallen to bucket of water tooo ( trust me...I TRIED..) . BASS QUALITY - I CANNOT GIVE IT 5 STARS but I wanted to give it 4.5 because it's enough and satisfy by almost all issues.According to manual , earbuds require 1.5 hrs to full charge ( VERIFIED ),  and the case  require about 3 hrs to full charge ( didn't verify , bcoz charge is still 3/3 bars , even after 5 days straight usage after receiving the earbuds ...never charged even on first usage...)So  for me I'm VERY VERY SATISFIED with these earbuds. Warranty was also done neatly and easily. 1 year warranty. You call either miss call call given number on warranty card or register on warranty page from website account of Boult Audio. Within 24 hours I got email confirmation and even a call to verify warranty details..... CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ALSO GREAT...THEY WILL TAKE A LITTLE TIME..BUT THEY DO PROVIDE .SO I RECOMMEND GUYS ,, GO FOR IT...U WONT BE DISSAPPONTED....

I'm extremely disappointed ,idk who's responsible but I cannot see the refund option at all I want a refund and NOT A REPLACEMENT . Poor call connectivity , the person on the other side of the call could clearly hear the noise of the cars even though I was far away from it . There's a huge lag between the audio and video time and after charging the product for the first time there was a burning smell coming from the AIRPODES . Requesting whosoever is responsible to refund my money because it's not even been one day and I don't want to use your product

Decent pair of airpods. Connects well to my phone but not to my macbook. This is a second pair after the first had the same problem, but still no solution to that. Sound quality is good, so is the bass (fix music EQ settings on your phone for optimum performance). Call reception quality is not good and call keeps dropping off. Touch sensor reactions on the pods could be smoother during transitions.Overall pretty good for music listening. Noise cancellation is solid. Takes getting used to. 3.5/5 ⭐️

First talking about sound quality and Bass then it's really good, the vocals quality and crispness of sound is really amazing. Bass is also very good it gives a premium bass boosted sound not like other bass filled junk tws which just fill your ear with heavy bass. The feel and build material is very nice it feels premium and sturdy although the case is heavy. Call quality is not good here you can expect average performance in this section because the person on call wasn't able to hear my voice properly when i was siting in my office under a fan noise cancellation doens't work here. Everything about this TWS is good Sound quality, Bass, Connectivity, Build expect one thing and that is...........Comfort, Yes they feel uncomfortable in while wearing, my ear size is average not small neither large. After wearing it for first 10 minutes it felt very painful, i thought i will get used to it but even after 3 days it was uncomfortable so i had to return the TWS. Please make decision wisely based on your ear size.Apart from this eveything is great about this TWS

Any branded product puschased can have issues. But this company expects it's customers to send their products to Delhi for repairs. Their only service center is in delhi. They have sales all over India, but service is only in Delhi. I have their faulty product, now I need to bare the cost to send it to Delhi, I have no clue when it will get there( if it will get there?).The money they paid to Vicky Kaushal, half of that is required to setup a service center in another city. Most stupid service I have ever heard.

Boult Air bass powerbuds are good product.Superb sound quality, superb call quality, superb battery backup.Only the problem is connectivity. After using atleast for 15 days, I faced the problem of connectivity. I have to refresh it if I want to use on next day or after couple of time. It dont connect or mis behave sometime and hence I have to unpair it, restart the buds and then connect again. Once restart and connecting again, afterwards no any issue. but on second day you have to do the same thing again which is somehow tiresome.It doesnot support connectivity with my laptop which is a big drawback for me.

The 120 hours charging case is good. The fit is not that good for my ear. I have boat 441 pro and it fits so smoothly. These earbuds are slightly larger and not so comfortable. But the price different between 441 and this is alot.Earbud tips could have been softer but you can always change it. The gestures are working.Double tap to play or pause. Long press left or right earbud to change video. Volume change doesn't work with YouTube app because it changes the video.Overall, no connectivity issue. Excellent battery life. Gestures are working but not that comfortable depending on your ear.

Hi. I bought this things 2 days ago.Its average as you'd expect.Mediocre mids and highs.Bass is good tho.The earbuds do not turn off easily when placed in the case. I assume that is something to do with bad design of the case leading to misaligned pins, but at this price I wouldnt expect a good all rounder.Its alright if you need a pair of wireless earphones. Nothing special.Get a jabra if you need a good pair.Hi woman from customer care.

Well. I would like to write a review on Boult audio powerbuds, Let me tell you that Boult Power buds are sleek and good for wearing on your ears for a longer period of time, But the issue that I have experienced is there are a lot of Connectivity issues on Bluetooth , found that both of the earbuds are not getting connected during important calls or Teams meeting , really regret when your Boult buds start malfunctioning and refuses to pair at the right time , sometimes your left bud pairs up and your right bud just remains dumb until u give a long press and then force it to pair .....Really not satisfied buying this product after much review , Adding to this there is also no indication shown in the box how much it charges when it goes for complete charge or if it is not complete You have to just remove it after 1 or 2 hours assuming that it has fully charged, Other than this there are not much issues that I have faced from this Boult audio buds.......I cannot say its totally vfm..... :-(

This is my third Boult Audio earphone. For the price bracket, Boult Audio products are perfect. The power buds are great for someone who listens to music with lot of bass. For someone like me who listens to a mix of songs from Pop, Rock, Jazz, IndieMix etc there are times when I prefer the bass to be lower. Also, I personally found that during jogging the power buds fall off. My ears are small & the buds don't sit snugly. This will be solved with an external accessory of a ear loop. All said and done this is an extremely good product & will suit the needs for most people who are looking for a quality product with an economical cost.

These cute little buds are the best under this price range. Sound quality is decent. if you are huge bass lover this might be a little disappointing. Noise cancellation can be improved but other person can hear the voice clearly. They would take nano second to respond but otherwise touch controls are really sensitive and works all the time. Volume up and down are a clever way to adjust works absolutely fine. I tested google assistant its really responsive u have press any bud for 2 seconds and ask google whatever u want. These are Sweat proof and won't fall down even when you do intense workouts. They can be little uncomfortable around the edges because of the plastic if u use them for a long time but i guess this is the case for all ear buds so no complaints in that area. They fit in my ear perfectly. I didn't really test water resistance capability but have been using these for almost a week Battery is also impressive and i can say money well spent considering the price range. Thumbs up from my side.

Don't buy this product. Very worst product for voice call. Can't able to hear voice from other end. Very poor customer service. Today I've spoke with one of the customer care about my product issue. She said, there is no service centre in India. If 1 year got over then we need to throw out. No other service provided by them. What non-sense they're talking. All Boult products will works only for 1 year and after that we need to throw out. Likewise customer care said. When I bought new, within few days I got voice call issue and after sending lot of emails and phone calls, I got replacement. So guy's don't go with Boult product. Think before purchase from this worst brand Boult.

Totally disappointed with this Boult product, no sound quality, no bass, if you buy once, you must enjoy with this worst one, because there is no option for return or refund, only replacement, but no one like to replace worst one to another worst one, once you buy, you should keep with you and suffer with it. Total money waste, Finally result is, They sell 2400mah power bank for 2200rs

I'm going to give a detailed review of this product but first I want you all to know that I've used boat 441 and sony c500 , which are rated as the best one . So , you can say that I have experience of earbuds 😂😂.Pros :1.Youtubers says that this earbuds gives you an average sound quality but that's not true . Its sound quality (overall) is very very better than boat 441 and gives a tough competition to song c500( worth 6000rs.) .2. Huge battery backup . Charge once ( case ) and you can use it for the whole month . I uses these earbuds atleast 6 to 7 hours a day .3. Fits perfectly.  Once they are  putten up in a perfect manner , there's no chance they can fall .4. Build quality.  Earbuds gives you an premium look and there's no funky lights and I like that that they've used lights only for important indicators.5. It doesn't reminds you again and again that your battery is low cause I don't like those repetitions.6 . As makers says that this product is made with IPX7  so I tested it myself , I took a bath wearing them and no single on them , and i trust their water resistivity this much that i can do it all day . And touch sensors works perfectly in the shower too.Cons :Now this product also got some problems with perfection .1. Case build quality: This case is very big in size so carrying it in your Jean's pocket is not a good idea and also the cap of the case is loose .2. Comfort : This earbuds gives you comfort but not so much . I would rate its comfort 3.5/53.Touch sensors : Since its touch area is small , it does not function that much good .3.5/5 and also its functions are quite complicated .4. Connectivity : This earbuds works perfectly when you are little far from the phone but it's my daily routine to take my dogs on walk and I sees a huge lag in the connectivity between my phone and these earbuds even when my phone is in my side pocket .These are some things I wanted you all to know . I would highly recommend you these beasts which are perfect for me and for you too . Best buds I've ever seen.

This is truly worth the price. I was seeing the negative rewiews and was vary of buying the same. But I decided to go for it.Result: Extremely good, without any flaws. I don't know why the reviews are negative because the quality is awesome. The warranty of 1 year makes it worthy to buy. The bass is good and it comes with buds(the ear buds- rubber) of different sizes so there is notice cancelation according to requirement. The bass is up to the mark. I was using Bose Soundsport which was worth 18k. It broke recently and I thought of not ape ding too much this time. And to my surprise the sound quality is a s same as Bose, never expected, now I regret why didnt I find this earlier. Do not see the negative reviews and 100% go for it. Its worth the pruce

Sound Quality: Excellent. Clear Sound at low and high volumes. Bass Quality: Amazing. Not too strong, not too weak. Noise cancellation at high volumes is very good. Battery Life seems good. Case is bulky due to high power capacity. Pairs easily. Easy to use. Touch controls are good and quite sensitive. Google assistant works well. Voice recognition is good even when whispering. Charging Cable is very short.Only complain: Silicon cover over charging plugs is slightly loose which will loosen more over use. Hard cover would have been better.

Paid ₹1,999/- for this pair of ear buds.  Full confession: I'd never used bluetooth earpods before.  Mostly I needed this for making calls (work calls on Zoom, etc., and phone calls).  Sometimes listen to music, or watch a movie.  For calls: sound quality is perfect, but audio quality clearly not as good as the built-in microphone in a MacBook.  On the phone, sometimes the bluetooth connection is automatically lost (but happens very rarely).  I am very satisfied with these earbuds for phone call usage.  For music and movies: sound quality is acceptable, but I know could be better.  The case is plastic, light, small (can go into your trousers, or inner jacket pocket of your blazer, and causes no inconvenience), holds a good charge, and doubles up as a power source to charge your phone on the go.These earbuds won't blow your mind.  But they are sturdy and they work.  A working man's pair of bluetooth earbuds.  Gave me good value for money.

It's a very good product and its best thing is its battery life, its very huge and works for 4-5 days if you use regularly and the bass is also very good but you cannot use it for gaming because there is a voice drop and the charging case has a in-built power bank in it and the case also works for a long time, I am reviewing it after 1 month and the earbuds also fits perfectly in your ears. I would recommend it for you if you want TWS earbuds, must buy.

I got my product delivered in two days despite the lockdown. I faced some connectivity issues as my left earbud used to get disconnected every once in a while. I ordered for a replacement and Amazon brought me a replacement in two days and picked up the unit I wanted to return from my doorstep.Got it on Friday and I'm writing This review on Monday evening after using the earbuds on and off for three days. I'm yet to charge the main case . And my earbuds give me a backup of around 5 hours in one go . Must say I'm satisfied with the battery backup so far.For the price range 2.5k , this offers good sound quality . Highs mids and the lows are pretyokay sounding with decent bass. Would have sounded better with AptX.The touch response is decent and I love that I can use it to change volume, play/pause and next/ previous track.I can use either left or right earbud alone which is convenient.And let me address the latency issue.For Normal music and video playback this is good.Not at all suitable for PUBG.Let me mention it here because I looked to see if there were any reviews talking about the latency while playing PUBG.I play a lot of PUBG and I still use my wired earphones for it.Overall I'm satisfied with the productIf you're looking for a budget earbuds with good sound quality and amazing battery backup, this is definitely an option.

I liked the quality of the product but its really not that comfortable to wear for long time. Battery backup was good but the touch buttons do not work properly specially when you need it. The sound quality is not that great but at this price tag almost all bluetooth headphones will sound like that only. So overall its a good buy for a price range of 1800. All the best!

Hello Everyone, I have received this product and after a heavy usage, found all PROS and No CONS which are helpful to the new buyers.Superb Deep Bass is wonderful and we would definitely love Music. A good battery backup is required and it can be possible with this product. Also the build quality is good and the charging case has TYPE C which is actually useful. I hope my suggestion would help you guy's.

The quality of the sound is not at all upto the mark. The money that you pay are paying is not at all as per the expectations. I love quality sound and I am a gadget, games and movie freak. So, I know what quality is. Bass is negligible. Sound clarity is good but it's too loud and will cause a headache. Moreover the case doesn't pair with the buds properly. Lights signalling the charge percentage doesn't work properly.

They should remove term ‘Bass’ from these buds. I am using these buds with iPhone 11.- poor bass- bass gets distorted at high volume- weak volume. Even at max volume you would feel it is less.- touch gestures are too sensitive.- a few hours after delivery, one of the buds was not delivering any sound.All in all, I feel it is highly overpriced for the quality. A fair price would be ₹1,000-1,200.

1. Putting back into case doesn't switch off earbuds2. Touch command do not work as expected3. Sound quality is crap and not loud4. Inconsistent behavior5. NON RETURNABLE PRODUCTBasically nothing advertised works perfectly. I returned it once and even the replacement was faulty.Noise shots X5 Pro is a better option or the JBL infinity.

One of the worst product I ever bought. More hype.Road side headphones/ products are better than this product.1. No bass at all.2. Difficulty in pairing both earpods.3. No noise cancellation4. Cannot use for calling, recieved/caller never listens volumes are very very low.There is no refund on this product.I request you to go for only known brands.

I like sound quality, I always trust Amazon's review this time there no description that noise cancelation is available for music only not for calling my main purpose was 5o buy this product for calling only. I have ordered this product to make calls, as I'm working from as a freelancer and sometimes there is a lots of noise behind due to house hold chores, like cleaning utensils, dusting furniture etc.. over the call it catches surrounding voice, I have called my couple of clients and they were not able to listen anything, I had to turn off my room fan had to keep the environment Pinedrop silent to complete that call. It's only good for listening music. I have reaserched alot to buy the best noise cancelation ear buds,  also Amazon shouldn't confused buyers, it's showing 3.9 stars for noise cancelation that for music only not for calling

Writing this after about a month of usage.The overall build quality and sound is quite good for the price range. I had been using jbl and bought this as an experiment and it fulfills the purpose.There is no noise cancellation as far as i know, but the design make interference minimal.Battery life is good. Have used for 5 hour long stretches.Sound lag occurs sometimes which needs you to put the left plug back in box and allow it to re pair with the right one. Dont think it is an issue. Will use some more to understand.Touch is quite sensitive and would take a little while to get used to especially while recieving calls.Warranty registration was online without any issues.All in all a good buy at this range.

Best in Battery Charge !All most a Day full , I tested watching Movies and By musiq , Stand By for Calling Purposes, The Quality also Good.It really Shows a Good Performance !The Reverse Charging also A Nice Feature!I charged my phone with that Power Bud Case.Overall The Best in all requirements.

I purchased for calling purpose and it was showing noise cancellation feature but in reality ASN does not work in it. Plus there is issue in auto connection and clear voice. One should avoid it. It can be used for listening songs or watching movies only. Disappointed not recommended for anyone looking for call purpose

The buds fit in the ear properly. There are 3 size of cuffs and one of them will fit for sure. Clear bass and good sound quality given the price range.with medium to heavy use, the buds lasts about 5-6hrs on one charge. The charging case has enough juice to last for another 3-4 full charge.I didn't had to charge the case for a full week with medium usage. That's and excellent feature.Also they fit well inside the helmet as well. So wearing the buds while riding is comfortable.overall very satisfied with the purchase. worth the money.

This tws is very useful for me and it's a very good choice while comparing other brands and iam very lucky to buy this on offer price at rs.1500 and the sound quality and the whole process we can change through touching the earbuds we can change the music,calls or whatever.. And especially charging case and battery is very helpful and it helds large amount of battery percentage And I have only one cons as my opinion the charging case is little big and it cannot fits in the pant pocket and it's look weird inside the pocket,and I understand why is so big in size for the battery purpose ok that's fine in future products the boult brand came better for my cons  think so....And thankyou for this awesome product from boult ❤️

The shipping carton was bent from side. Seal of the the outer box was broken from one side. Boult Budcase has scratches on the top side body. Right side earpiece doesn't fit in the charging socket properly.Update - I received a replacement with the similar scratchy black box. Also this time the pods were unable to charge as they dont fit properly in the sockets. Magnetic locks dont hold them properly. Need these replaced as well.

A couple of days ago after I had my 1st purchase of Boult Audi AirBass PowerBuds, I had a chat with a customer service executive Ms. Neha K who had issued a ticket for change of the said Airpods, due to only 1 defect and that was when I had to change the song to next, I was supposed to press the right Earbuds for 2 secs and the same process was to be followed for going back to the previous song. But to my surprise, the changed product, which I received yesterday consists of the same defect ! Now what to do ? We trust Amazon,  and this is not only the first time I've purchased through Amazon, but I am a regular customer. Please help me again by replacing the product, otherwise I'll have to approach consumer forum. Thanks

Purchased on 4/11/2021 reviewing it after a couple of days of usage. Design looks stylish and premium. Especially the LED on buds look awesome. Following are my observations.Pros:* From the date of purchased i charged the case only 2 times, Battery Back up is too good 10/10* Ear bud battery is also good 8/10* Sound is also Good 8/10* Easily fitted on ears.* Lightweight* No connectivity issues found as suchCons:* On call, quality is worst, Other side can't get your voice clearly. facing voice issues.* Touch sensitive is too much sensitive, not able to adjust the earpiece while in an active call. Touching anywhere in the earpiece while in a call has cut the call most of the time.* Charging case is bit heavy* Difficult to manage between voice assistant and volume adjustment.Overall it's a decent product within its price range, but for calls you should not go with it.

I've been using boult twinpods for the past two yrs which has poor build quality but the quality of bass and sound were on point and recently I lost it and so I bought this product ....I  seriously didn't have not much expectation bt still I'm super disappointed and my trust has been broken🥲Build quality was great ngl bt the sound and bass it hurts every time 🥲I was unable to have the product in my hand for 8 days cause I got struck due to some issues and so the return/refund time limit elapsed 🥲The latency is low compared to boat airdopes 441 bt if you're looking for good sound and bass .... just buy the boat airdopes 441 or 441pro

The design is not as expected to fit in th ears, despite changing the bud rings.Good :The charging is good and last long. The found quality is good, effective and awesome. Good to use it only for ear bud charging only.Not so good :The inbuilt power bank is not effective as it gets heated up when the mobile is connected to charge. Refinement is required.

Sound Clarity Is Really Good...Balanced Vocals , And Not Supressed By Heavy Bass.Bass Is Deep And Not Distorted ,  You Can Feel It In Your Eardrums.Easy To Carry And Premium Looking Finish.Battery Life Is Descent...If you're a 9 to 5 worker then it's a great deal for you. In a single charge it can run your music whole day whenever you want.I didn't used it as a power bank so no comments on that.IF YOU LIKE TO HEAR CLEAR VOCALS AND BASS THEN IT'S FOR YOU...ATTENTION :- 💀NOT FOR LOUD LISTENERS💀

Why the call it Bass . Sound of mic appreas ok but very sensitive . Mabe to sensitive for loud areas and videos.  The Sound quality feels tin like and flat Base is terrible no kick no feeling . Very strange Sound personally not upto the mark at all for the supposed price of 9k ... bought for 1999. But I think boat is much better quality ...Also head phones get hot after charging ... Will try it for a day but likely I will send it back .

•Got a defective one and returned for a replacement.•The second one also doesn't work properly.•Sometimes they don't get charged despite keeping in the case for hours.•People often cannot hear me clearly or at all on phone conversations•They don't work despite being fully charged and connected to phone. One side or both fail to deliver sound frequently. It's super annoying

I ordered this product thinking that i was somewhat unlucky with the first time i ordered it as it was a defected piece. I got it replaced and the replaced one's also got defected in 2-3 days. The sound quality and bass is also not satisfying. Noise cancellation doesn't work at all. So plz don't by boult, buy sony. They are a hundred times better.

Bought these about two months ago, have been using them regularly since, the powerbuds are pretty great. The ear takes some getting used to the size of it, but not too much of a hassle.The controls are tricky to get a hang of though, on very long calls I inevitably end up cutting the call once because the tap section is quite sensitive.So this was all the good.Now comes the REALLY BAD PART - Their customer service. Oh my god. They are like stalkers.They ask you to call on a number to register the warranty of your product, and once you do that, you have hell to pay, because people start HOUNDING you to give them a (positive) review. To a point where they will call you 3 times a day and eventually beg you because apparently they get paid per review.I really regretted buying the product 7 days after getting it because from day 2 till 7, I had gotten more than one call a day asking about the product and to review it. Eventually had to block the number for some peace of mind.If you can deal with the hounding, I'd recommend the product. If I had to do it all over again, knowing this would happen, I probably wouldn't.
"

After using for a week i can summarise the review. Its sound quality is really good. Bass is good at moderate volume. Noice cancellation can be improved little bit. You can wear this headphone whole day and you fill no irritation. Its light weight and easy to fit in ears. Its battery is staying upto 6 hours in music and call. Its case is like itself a powerbank. Its like never loosing battery of the earbuds. Both are working as masters so you can use any one at a time. Also as soon as you open lid of the box it will get connected to the device. At last its really great product in this price range.

▪︎Awesome ""sound quality"" and a clear ""bass quality"" but i won't recommend for online classes like zoom or Google meet.▪︎The call clarity and noise cancelation is also perfect.▪︎The touch controls works efficiently for limited apps.▪︎While watching movies I Can feel a bit lag for 2 seconds and works normally again .▪︎Good and easy touch controls only for mobile and tab.▪︎I guess its been 8 days since i start using,the battery is still 100%.▪︎Guys importantly don't be scared after reading single star negative comments under this product.▪︎Even I was scared to buy seeing those comments but i truly got a nice product from AmazonSO GO FOR IT...!!

The buds look nice and fit well in my ears. The touch controls work like a magic for me, I use it the most. The call quality is okay and expected at this price range.The buds claim passive noise cancellation with I believe is somewhat okay but not great.The sound quality is very good as per the the price segment. The sound is crisp and clear, vocals are great. The bass is okay and not over powering.Battery is great! They ran for hours! Case is strong..gets dirty quick though.I currently owned the China version of the Redmi Airdots and this is definitely an upgrade!Overall satisfied.

Believe me guys just go for it. Don't think too much it's a total value for money product. Even better than a 4 thousands bugs earbuds available in market.  And it's battery life is just awesome...even buds last for about 9-10 hours in my usage I always listen music 30 to 40% level incresing above to 40% is too high for me.... Don't get me wrong... The sound quality is also decent even on 95% volume and even on 100% sound quality doesn't flatuate..... Thumbs up for boult audio from my personal good experience...... 👍👍

I observed that the design of the product is really good. It comes with different sized ear piece including the one attached in the device. Still the Boult falls now and then from our ear. The design can be further improved. I observed that with phone, the connectivity is good, while, with computer, the device is connectivity is not that great.

Very good built quality, good battery with around 4 hours of play time on the buds with one charge. I fully charged the case a day ago and charged the buds twice till now and the battery indicator on the case still shows full. Sound quality is also very good only downside is bass is a bit underwhelming, don't get me wrong there is bass but it's not the boom boom stuff. One more downside is the touch control on the buds is hyper sensitive, it just needs a touch of your cloth or cap. I got the Boult power buds for 1999 INR with the lightning sale discount so I am extremely happy with it because of the very good sound quality and battery life. However at the listed price of 8k I wouldn't be happy with underwhelming bass and glitchy touch control.

This is my first time having fully in ears so I don't have much of a comparison against the others, but as a person who's been using wireless headphones for a while these ones are great! I've only used them sparingly in times when I need to exercise or I have to have myself truly free without having something around my neck, or hanging down, and they live up to the name! The battery is truly ridiculous on the charging unit, I even tested charging my phone from the charging unit and it works even though it doesn't do dash charging it still serves as a valid source of power in the case of emergencies. As for the headphones themselves their noise canceling isn't that great but I need to be aware of the outside world at times so they have the perfect amount of noise canceling for me to still be aware of what's happening around me.Buy it if you want,the battery itself should be enough of an easy reason, and the sound quality is great!

This is my first product from Boult. Let me give a slight brief that the company Boult Audio and Boat both are indian brands.Now, coming to the product Boult Audio Airbass Powerbuds.Better than its predecessor Boult Audio Airbass TrueBuds in terms of:1. Battery obviously, the buds itself has a battery of 45mAh and the case has 2200 mAh of battery.2. The charge in the buds lasted for 6 hours approximately,In my use.3. The logo on the buds lights up in blue color while charging and blinks white when charged fully. And trust it looks awesome!4. the case open and pair feature works fantastically.5. Very very comfortable to wear for long hours, a very optimal improved design than its predecessor.6. The box suprisingly is not that big and bulky as it seems here in the pictures.7. The audio is fantastic. The bass is up to mark. No complaints. Sound is loud and clear, overall a very impressive sound for indian audiophiles.8.call quality is good. It do register surrounding noises but the main voice is registered appropriately and loud.9. The front pannel of the case has the ""Type C"" port for charging and ""Usb A"" for charging your phone as it can act as a powerbank also.10. Latency while playing pubg is not that much. The game is playable.11. Touch controls works fine.Now some cons:1. No mention of driver size here in the manual.2. The case quality is good. But the lid feels a little loose. Dont get me wrong the build quality is good but its just the lid which is a bit loose.Thats it!The product is very much recommendable. Just Go for it!

The buds are good according to their price. I don't know how it might perform in a long run.Pros:1. Battery backup is really good2. Fast bluetooth connectivity3. Touch controls are ultra sensitive4. The sound is pleasant for long time users.Cons:1. Sometimes one bud get connected instead of two. Again we have to put it back in the box and again reconnect it.2. Noise cancellation is ok not excellent.3. Difficult to understand the blinking led system sometimes.

There is only one service centre of Boult and tht is in Delhi. Product has most common issue of not working one of the pair and for that you need to bare 200/300 courier charges and they have a robot chat to answer your questions. Very disappointed with the service.I would recommend not to buy this brand and select another one.

They are very good Earbuds. Nice Audio, Bass & Quality is top notch. One star less because it hurts your ears after 1.5 hour of usage. All touch controls working excellent and very responsive also.

Pathetic microphone, I only bought this because it mentioned that microphone quality is superior.Very disappointed.Opened the product after 7 days and hence customer care refusing to retrun or replace it.Update - Boult replaced the product but with a damaged box and the voice quality is still pathetic.For listening its fine but for calling the mic keeps on omitting a few words every 10sec, as if my i am moving farther to the earbuds and then coming closer to it, like a wave.This is beyond my patience, local Chinese earbuds perform better. Not a brand any1 should trust

The sound quality is the same as 1000ish wired earphones, but the 120 hour long battery life and convenience of true wireless is worth it in this price.It's not perfect, gesture controls are bad, I had some trouble with connectivity during phone calls, but otherwise this is a great purchase.

While purchasing, it was advertised on the Amazon site, that it's a water proof IPX7 earbud but on the box and on its manual and features, it's not mentioned anywhere that it's a IPX7 protected earbud.Secondly, the right ear bud lapses in sound and unable to provide sound many a times while in use.And many times sound is not coming through buds while receiving notification from other aaps .. and it is to be connected again.So I want to return this product.It's not IPX7 .. and also defective.

Worst product ever ordered two days ago delivery came today, the left earbud is not working not working, not working is an understatement it doesn't even turn on. It is defective tried to get refund for this product but it says replacement only no refund is available for this product. Now waiting for replacement to arrive. Don't buy this product. Having the worst experience from Boult Audio, keep this up & your sales will hit rock bottom very soon, very disappointed in this product.

Boult Audio AirBass Power Buds are very responsive Bluetooth ear buds.This are my views after about a month of use. Over all rating is 4.8 Stars from my sidePors:1) Easily pairs with mobile once lid is opened of charging case2) In single charge if used as single bud, 1 and half day for calls, and 5 hours for video content3) If both the buds are used for call and video content it last for one full day4) Charging case supports reverse charging for charging mobiles etc.5) Charging case chargers the buds minimum 5 times on single charge6) Very good for music, video.7) Single bud can be paired with mobile, range of connectivity is excellent if there is no physical obstruction between the mobile and ear budsCons.1) Its touch controlled, so while even if you try to adjust the buds while answering a call even slight touch on the face of the buds disconnects the call. (over responsive touch control)

While the sound quality won’t match that of AirPods or so, it’s extremely convenient to use these earphones. I won’t recommend these as your top choice sound quality earphones, but certainly a great cheaper replacement for AirPods.

Really good earbuds, long battery life as stated. These ran for about a week and 3 days without charging the case. Buds battery life is around 6-9 hours. Mic is okay ig, should speak louder since other person can't seem to hear you. If you are looking for bass then these ain't the ones you should go for. I recommend these for the people who want high battery life and good enough sound to listen to music and yes they don't fall of while running, they hurt when u wear them for the first time but u will get used to it and they fit perfectly the next time. Overall rating :- 4.3/5

I have been a great fan of boult audio right from the beginning as it had always justified a soundThis product is also an addition to my list and it again has fullfiled all my requirementsThe sound is awesome you can feel a deep bas along with balanced trebleSnug fit makes it best for notice cancellationU will be in a different world altogether.

Product design n quality of sound is better than its competition. Battery life seems to have reduce to 7 hrs after six months of usage n accidental overcharging. Power bank comes handy when used.Make sure you are using smart charger to avoid overcharging.

First of all if you going to buy these for calling purpose you will be disappointed by these product. It doesn’t have that much quality of mic in it other one will not hear your voice.noise cancellation is better not that much good. Sound quality was impressive was having good quality of Bass,clearity was also good if you wish to buy for gaming,music & movie purpose you can go ahead even battery backup is good,but I am returning these product as i was facing issues of frequent Disconecting,Right side Bud was not working properly,charging case was getting hot while charging

, if it is connected to a device then you need to remove from that device to pair it with other device even though the first device is turned off. Also, you cannot take meetings with this one as you have to speak in your laptop microphone . Really not happy with this one . Will not recommend to anyone. Rather buy a simple earphone

The sound quality is good, noise cancelation is not good as the other person is easily distracted by the background noises. The bass quality is really good. One thing about this is that they are quickly connected as soon as you open bluetooth. The touch controls are a but weak but it can be ignored if sound matters to you most. I was using Noise x1 shots and if compared, Boult is much much better. Good truly wireless earphones in budget.

-Hard plastic on outerside is painful after longer duration (if your ears are smaller)-The flashing lights seems confusing unless you refer to manual carefully-Noticed the white light in logo flashing while you wear earbuds but are not using it for some time. This is totally unnecessary and looks funny as you move with flashing lights in your ears.-Sound quality is good / okay - toward-Control is easy once understood-Best part is you can use any one earbud individually

Fantastic Product! I am loving every bit of it.The product built is fantastic. The case finish is luxurious with a black shiny feel. The Ear pods are light weight, very comfortable rubber pads that fits so well. The fit is perfect for fitness activities as well. The touch on the ear pods for performing multifunctions is another plus. However,all functionalities working perfect like receiving etc.Coming to the sound part, I can say it's beautiful. The bass is very good and almost strikes the perfect balance. The sound is very soothing to the ears.The product design makes you look stylish and classy. I strongly recommend purchase of this product if you are a music lover who wants to go for truly wireless options

Worst product. Don't buy this earbuds. I saw most of the positive reviews also but this product is waste of time and money. There is no extra bass and while continuously using for an hour, it automatically disconnected. Don't see the money on spending in earbuds. try *boat airdopes 441pro . Boat airdopes is the best option.

Dont consider this brand and please go with the any Boat headset itself which we can trust and the quality wise it's good..Because they have mentioned in their website that  with this we can use the volume raise / decrease by touching the bud for 3 secs Continuously but that option is not given with the piece which i received...Regarding this I've called the boult customwr care also but they are not at all responding anything and they even don't know about their own products..Boat is giving better service and product than this...i was using boat for several years and i juat wanted to try a new brand and i bought this but I'm frustrated after receiving this..

Awesome earbuds, great sound quality, good bass. First time connection took all of 10 sec. Afterwords, connects within 2-3 sec after opening the case. Best thing, you can use either of the two buds individually like a hands free. No Master-Slave problem like with other earbuds I have used.Haven't used them extensively so can't comment on prolonged use but did experience some disconnections and earbuds powering off a few times while wearing. Could be defective piece so don't make judgements. The case was showing fully charged but still on a hunch I charged the case and buds for a couple of hours to resolve the power off problem. Will update if again faced with the disconnection and powering off problem.Removing 1 star for the same however.Otherwise, these are awesome. Just go for it.

Got the product on about 20 days back, I had to charge the base only twice till now & the second charge is still about 30%.I work for 12 or more hours every & of that I am on voice call od data call for about 8 hours and average, and for music in between.Both pods last for the day in mono mode. No need to worry about the charge.Sound quality and noise cancellation is good (not the best).Had tried 2 other brand products earlier but results were non satisfactory.Really happy to have this product.

They give lot of problems, connection is very slow, huge amount of latency,sometimes it automatically gets disconnected while listening music, and battery indicators doesn't work properly, and to much heat is generatedBut i like the battery backup upto 6 hrs we get that's way more compared to boatIt more comfortable for me more that boat rockerz 400Overall product is good not so bad but if they fix these problems then the product is amazing

they are really bad or i can say the worst because first of all they aren't fit in ears properly and after sometime you can feel the pain in your ears and i had purchased them 1 month back and now one side of it is not working , so you can understand how they are actually my opinion for these earbuds is that you should not waste your money
"

The sound quality and the bass is really really good, considering the driver size! The fitting could have been a little better! When i was searching for truly wireless earbuds on the amazon, i surely was NOT looking for something this bulky as it looks in the image, but my frnd who recently bought a boult product adviced my to go for it, and so when it came home(to be honest it was a little bulky) it takes at least 30sec to fit it properly, unlike other tail like buds which u can fit in just 5sec But i was really impressed by the quality! If u are a bass lover like me just know that whatever song I play the bass always feels like it has been amplified and soung quality doesn't get distorted by heavy bass, and thats the best thing!! even after using a bass booster application the bass didn't feel creepy and torn apart .The reverse charging power bank is not of much use here considering it has the output of 1Ampere, as all the new phones now have a battery of minimum 4000MAH. but still the power bank can be used if your phone is just about to die and you dont have any charging point near you, so it could give your phone from 0% to 15%-20% charge in 20minutes!

Best Earbuds in this price range !! Period.1. Audio : Audio quality is superb, even smallest of notes can be heard clearly  4/5 ⭐2. Bass : I use Sony MDRXB950-B1 extra bass Headphones so I know what real bass feels like. These Powerbuds give you a bass you'd not even expect !! (I'd suggest you to use any Bass booster app which will enhance the bass and you can make use of the full potential of these buds )  4.5/5 ⭐3. Battery Life :  I'd say most important feature of wireless buds is battery life and this guy here is the pro of it !!  2200 Mah case will give you more than twice the battery life than other buds out in market.5/5 ⭐4. Design : Nice asthetics for both buds and case gives a premium look. I'd suggest black colour over blue but of course you can select the colour you like.Fitting inside the ear is perfect yet comfortable and they won't fall even if you take a rollercoaster ride.4/5 ⭐5. Waterproof  : With IPX7 rating you keep these 1 meter underwater for 30mins and they'll work just fine !! Touch them with dirty hands wash off later with water !! Can use in sweating workout session as well. 5/5⭐Bottom Line(s):1. Best Earbuds you'll find with this price tag (I'd say performance is even better than many expensive earbuds)2. If you'll be using frequently for Calling DON'T buy it. You'll regret it for sure. For ocassional calling it's ok.3. The Pros supersede the Cons a hundred times so I'd say Just go for it. You'll not regret buying it for sure !!Overall rating  4.5/5 ⭐

If you are looking for meeting calls like zoom call, teams call or google meet call then, it will not work don't waste your time and money.This earbud not working with the laptop, every time it's disconnected, when your listening something both earphone not sync with each other . you feel both earbuds sounds coming one after another.

I'm an office going person, I have so much to catch up with, I don't have time to charge my phone as well, so I stress more on battery backup when it comes to gadgets. But when it's about earplugs, what matters the most is how do you enjoy your music, how well could you attend a call or how it doesn't fall off from your ears during your workout. These powerbuds are all about it. Must buy. Loved them. :)))
"

Design is light and doesn't feel on your ears. They have a long battery life which would not bother you for long time.Pairing is quick and easy, just open the box they gets connected automatically.Noise cancellation is not very good in them. Also could have had more than one mic.Touch operation of volume increase/decrease is almost useless since you have to continuous press for 3 secs which is slower.Overall as compared in market at this price they would well.
"
3242,"
The sound quality is pretty good at the price range no complains about that.But the touch is a little bit lacking for the proper control over ur music or anything u are listening to.The tap for picking up the call is good but and tap for disconnecting the call causes slight problem becoz when taking call on bed a slight touch of the body like ear or a slight touch {unwanted} cuts the call and its a minor annoyance. I think the 3s for volume up is good to replace the cut call scenario . And add a sliding function for volume up and down . And the call quality needs a slight improvement.Other than that it's a solid purchase.

The sound quality is not good. The battery does work for hours as described in product description.The charging stopped after few days. There is no service station functional.

The sound, noise cancellation and bass are all good.

Never had seen or heard this Brand before bought these PowerBuds with lots of hesitation. Finally after unboxing I was amazed to the sound quality, Noise Cancellation. The Bass is kind of okk & not for people who love listening Metal, EDM or Hard Rock. Still I give it 5⭐ for its performance

I have used these earbuds for about a month now and it has pleasantly surprised me with its sound quality and its battery capacity, especially considering its nominal cost. It pairs well with both phones and laptops and there is no noticeable latency. The design of the earbuds is quite ergonomic and it fits in nicely in the ear which accentuates passive noise cancellation. The reverse charging feature is also a very nice and helpful feature. Overall, it is definitely worth consideration when buying good quality budget TWS earphones.

After using a week here's my reviewPros :1. Battery backup : Once charge and then forget, it will go too long atleast 90-100 hrs.2. Design : it's absolutely fit for jogging and completely cancels outside noise.3. Touch : Touch sensitivity is good.Cons1. Poor connection: it's ok but not too good. Approx 5-8 m range. Gets disconnected sometime.2. Comfortabllity : although it's subjective but can't put on for long time.3. Calling : it's worse, you have to speak loud to be heard by the person on the other side. Some time voice alse breaks.

Sound quality is goodNoise cancellation is goodMaster earbud has a problem in it - even though it has master earbuds the problem with it is after taking out the other one from the case u have to synce it again and again.Build quality is a very big factor in this for giving such low rating like in the first picture it is the left bud in which when u by chance touch the blue bordering outside the button it reacts to play/pause/sound low so basically even if u adjust the buds on the left side either music will stop or start to play.sometimes when u are on a call from ur laptop the person on the other side tends to hear the voice from far away.They have mainy focussed on their battery which is massive and rest IT NEEDS TO IMPROVE VERY MUCH ON ITS MASTER CONFIGURATION AND BUILD QUALITY.

I purchased Airbass powerpods from Amazon. I have been using this product for the past 2 days. Overall, it is a wonderful product. I have always placed my reliance over boult products as the first product i purchased were boult headphones that too 2.5 years ago and they are still good to use. Coming back to powerpods, it is fully loaded with features and are one of the best powerpods in this price segment. The only limitation faced is that if you are talking over call wearing both the powerpods i.e left and right then the other person won't be able to listen to you clearly due to echo. Might be this be due to the reason that be it left or right powerpod, they have mic. So while you are on a call, wear one powerpod then you would be properly audible to the other. Highly recommended product. Go for it

I am very happy with the performance of the product. It really solved my purpose of having one like this. Audio quality is very and very soothing to ears. Some ear buds I experienced discomfort and never fit into my ears. This one is very comfortable and nicely fitting into my ears. As I am using the touch control for 1st time, i am getting used to pause and play or taking calls and disconnect. Sometimes i disconnect the calls if i press for more than 1 sec.One challenge I have, but not sure everyone faces that. When I connect with my Mac for any conference calls, the control of ear buds taken over by itune application and not the application which I am want use i.e. if i play youtube and touch my ear bud, the itunes get activated and when i pause itune music get paused not the youtube.

Comfortable buds with good sound quality. Small size, so easily fit into ears. Noise Cancellation is also good, you are able to listen to music fine even in a noisy place. Battery backup is also good no doubts.The only con I felt that it is pathetic for calling. It's mic catches more noise as compared to caller's voice. The listener ends irritatingly putting off your call (they have to put in great deal of effort to understand what caller is trying to say, even in very low noisy environment.)If your purpose is calling, DONT DONT DONT TAKE IT.

One of the best you could get at this price band with reverse charging. It's been almost a month now and I haven't charged the case yet. Sound is good, you might sometime face issue with the background noise like you are completely not audible to the other person, so far twice I have faced this issue with noise cancellation, bass is good comparatively.Carrying case is a bit heavy, but that's completely okay as it provides a lot of power supporting reverse charging.As far as the built quality of the case is concern, I won't term it as cheap but of course it's quite light, it could have been better. I sometimes feel it could get disarmed if I don't open it with utmost care, but so far it's working good.One must go ahead and buy this if you're planning to buy. Worth buying it.

It has been few months since I bought this product I bought it back in December and I was pretty excited but it had few issues but the connectivity issues got resolved after some time.  I contacted the customer service back in December and I got a call in march asking about my issue , isn't that too long to finally provide customer service?As far for product the sound quality is amazing, since I have had it for few months I can guarantee that the battery backup, sound quality, fit and touch senses are on point. Try to get yourself around the product for atleast one day, it takes time to get a hand on it.Now for issues I have Noise cancellation lacks big time so I will say go for something else if you need noise cancellation. It catches onto background sounds a lot and the connectivity with calls has been an issue (tho it will stay connected for music , it doesn't stay connected for calls idk why) . the customer service Boult gives is not good .I hope they will work on their customer service.

Everything regarding the sound is excellent but I have used it for 4 hours since the order has arrived and it is killing my ears, to compensate I used only one earbud in monobud form but still it hurt after 30mins+. They don't even have a refund option with return so I have no use and its kinda waste of 2000INR. Luckily they gave THREE earbud sleeves (the rubber thing covering the end of the ear bud) with 3 different sizes so I changed it to small. The pain is more bearable now but it still hurts. The buds are very heavy compared to Moonwalk M2 which I ordered for my sister and I regret not ordering them for myself as well.

The sound quality is good, my main purpose was for listing music (and not gaming), they do a very good job at that in this price range. The product look and feel is also very premium, a little on the bulky side but that's works with me as it also acts as a backup power bank.

The product is good, have a decent voice and just-required bass. Quality is good no denying that.It works totally fine with the mobile phone and its microphone is also good, but1. its really troublesome with Laptop, It tends to disconnect at intervals although it connects back automatically.2. Mostly in case of a Meet or Zoom meeting via laptop, you will have to adjust the speaker and microphone from your system's settings as well as meet/zoom app for proper functioning and after that it gets disconnected occasionally then you will have to set everything once again and after that too you may end with earpodes at maximum volume (you will not be able to control the volume unless you choose hardware from the settings properly) and your microphone may not work as well.3. Lastly it will fit too deep inside your ears and they are large for a normal-sized ear also, and may fall off frequently.If you wont use them for laptop then you need to consider only the 3rd point of my review.

Super cool product. Don't think twice. Sound quality is awesome. And I did lot of research before buying... Better than boat airdopes 441 pro. Battery backup is really good. Design looks rich. Box is also matt finish and looks great. Pairing is instant and hassle free. It may seem big in your ears initially (fitting) but you will get comfortable soon. Noise cancelation is actually true for this product as special feature. Bit problematic taking calls in traffic but normal in room or elsewhere.

The Earbuds are good to look; performance for listening to music is decent too; however, these are not the best for calling. The other end hears a faint echo on calls, which mars the calling experience. If your primary use of these earbuds is calling, this is not the accessory to invest in.

•  Battery backup is the clear winner for this item. No worries about the charge. The case can charge the earphones so many times.• Connectivity is good. No issue at all while pairing anytime. Been using it for 15 days as of now.• Calling quality is not that nice but not bad too. Its good while there is no noise. One irritating thing is that the call gets disconnected even if you accidentally tap the earbuds.• Fit is perfect. No problem with that.• Build quality is great. Totally satisfied.• Sound quality is good.• Sometimes, on low charge maybe, the left earbud keeps losing and regaining connection.• Over all, nice product at this range . I would suggest go for it.

The headphones stopped working after 4 months and when I sent it for a repair, I was expecting it to get fixed, but they sent it back the same, without repairing it at all.Horrible experience, never buying Boult again. Go for any other big brand, this one has horrible tech quality and customer service.

If you looking for good audio calls ..this is not what you should get.. according to me..Other person cannot hear anything or its cracking..Alongwith it..case needs to have some slot..so that it can be tied to anything..

Pathetic. Poor noise cancellation and mic no one is able to hear your voice on call even after you yell . Gets disconnected again and again tried turning it on and off a thousand time already but still keeps disconnecting . Faced horrendous issues just after 1 month usage . Not worth at all.

Here is the review of 1 week usage.1. No need to worry about Battery Life. It has really good battery backup.2. Sound Quality is good but the volume level doesn't match with my old BoAt Rockerz 255. Am feeling BoAt is having good volume level.3. Build quality of case is fine as of now.

When i ordered it first i got delivered a broken product and only 1 ear bud was working and still with connection issues. Then the next day itself i kept for replace of product, then i got a used product woth full of scratches and no safety covers and seal was broken already. I instantly kept the product for return. Its was a worst service and expireance

I have been using this product for around 2 months.The sound quality is awesome.Bass is top notch. If you are a bass lover, you will not be disappointed. (""Extra Bass"" as mentioned in the product description is worth it but it becomes a bit comfortable on full volume)The buds do not come out while running or exercising.The 2300mah battery is massive, no need to charge the case frequently.The touch controls are good, sometimes they show a minor lag but overall, it's manageable.The case also looks up to the mark but it's hinge seems to be a little fragile.Overall sound experience is very good.A must buy product in this price range.

The earbuds are working very well. The sound  quality is good. It's comfortable to wear and convenient to control the music / calls through touch options on buds. The design of the buds along with the case is also elegant. Overall a nice product. This is the third time we are buying this product!For the price point, it has the below pros:1) Good soundstage and instrument separation2) Balanced mids and treble, although the apund signature is slightly warm3) Bass is punchy, but not overpowering.4) Decent passive noice cancellation. One can always buy foam tips from Comply to increase noise cancellation.5) Great battery.The only con that I can see ao far is the slightly heavy weight of the Charging Case. Although the same is offset by the fact that the case is still compact and easily fits in the pocket.

I have purchased this product in April 2021...Worst mic response and  noice cancellation ... it is almost impossible to call with this product even in a silent environment..Ok for music and bettry...But now even worse has happend its left ear bud is not at all working ...DO NOT BUY ...

Sound quality is GoodNoise cancellation is Also GoodBass quality is also Appreciate.Over all Average products .There is connectivity issues between Bud's pair while using 1 or both budsthey disconnected for few second and minutes and then they automatically connected .

Company genuine effort always be appreciated. My friends if u really search a compact,long battery product along with each earbud seperate connectivity with two different device then this will b perfect product for you. For battery I just use this product since March 21 and I charged only for 2-3 time and rarely remember when I charged this case last time.One lack I feel that is on voice call your voice to another end not too much clear other end always feels like a long distance soundso company should work on it.Otherwise overall very great product under this price segment

The charging case is not getting fully charged.

Good sound quality.... bass is little low but anyhow it's a good buy about noise cancellation its blocked all the sound from outside and if u r playing music or games no other sound can come into ur ear other than music one other thing battery backup is good I am continue playing since I have bought these and it has not depleted a single dot from the case sound quality is also good not too high not too low a little bass is missing in them as other boat products have more of them ... About touching control I would say they are too sensitive and detect any little bit of resistance .. like when u r lying down and ur podes touch pillow or anything or even a light touch from hand on adjusting pause music and it really have to be looked other than this it's a too fine product you can go for a buy at this price range they are best to buy

Hi, This is a genuine review post a weeks usage.The Products Build quality and Sound Quality is really good.Noise Cancellation not much great.Fits good unless you have a very small ear.It does hurts a bit when you use more than a hour.Usage with mobile for music and calls are excellent.Usage with Laptop really disappointed me. It creates lot of voice breakouts and erroneous noise when having Skype/Zoom calls.Bottomline:1. Best one for Mobile.2. Worst for Laptop especially internet based calls.Really hope Boult to respond to this issue. I also use a Boult Probass Curve which works fine with Laptop.

Don't buy this product, as it will not fit inside ears. If you press more ear wil get pain, it may fall down easily from ears. No proper design. i Suggest don't buy this product. It has return policy but only product replacement not return.

I mainly brought this product for Video/Audio calling and to listen to music during my gym hours.-Noise cancelation is disappointing as the other person cannot hear my voice loud and clear and I have to scream talking. but all the background noises are picked up by the microphone so I'll rate it 1.-If you are a bass lover, avoid this product since the quality of the bass is very poor and not very worth money. No value, No buy!

1. Preety good sound and build quality.2. Battery backup with case is tooooo good almost lasts week for me.3. Noise cancellation is decent considering this price segment.4. Does not work well for calling. It works for few minutes and then you get distorted voice or the person on the other side of the call gets to hear more background noise rather than mine which was the deal breaker for me.5. Touch Control has many helpful functions and can sometimes be a bit slow.TDLR: In this price segment if you are looking for TWS for anything except calling this is a great option.

The product when compared to similar category is worse. The mobile if its more than 2 feet away the earpod stops working or keep getting cut. The situation is worse when you keep it in yor track pants pocket whole jogging or walking, as soon as it's in my pant pocket I will only hear intermittent sounds some times for 10 seconds no sound at all.But otherwise in terms of battery capacity, sound quality this is good.

Sound clarity and bass quality and product quality is too good.Except mic quality.. if we use one bud, other person is not able to hear our voice clearly.. it comes very low voice..When we use both buds, then the voice sound will be better..When we take call in noise location or in traffic, then the mic performance is worst..If Boult company will clear this bug.. then no second thought to buy any one..

Given the price this one is best I think. Battery life is superb. Sound is superb, but with Sony medium sized silicon buds. The buds supplied with this were of smaller size for me and were not able to produce good bass. So I had to use medium sized buds of my sony wired ear buds.

Like -1) Good Sound2) Decent BassDislike -1) Noise cancellation not that good2) Interface for commands like changing song or volume is not intuitive. Instead of 2 taps, 3 taps if swipe gestures were used for changing music and volume that would be great. E.g. Up swipe on any bud increases volume and down swipe on left/right buds switches to previous/next song.
"

Sound quality got down after 2-3 months...noise cancellation good at first but is now completely dead....touch receptors become unresponsive sometimes...bass is good...mic position is inconvenient ( or could be defective in my case ) as most of the time half the sound doesn't reach....latency has increased...audio delay is acceptable... cannot handle too much audio so not suitable for meeting with friends and class online....other physical features are good such as water resistance,bass, durability etc.Note : This is after light usage for 2-3 months

Boult Powerbuds deliver nice sound, very low latency for gaming, and have very good battery time. Would recommend this product for people who don't prefer stem type buds, fits snugly into the ear. A slight hiccup could be the touch feature, need to remember different types of touch to control, but it's as responsive and fast as buttons. Just lookout for the price hikes, bought it for 1499 but now it shows 1799. Great product overall.

I am not satisfied with the product as it keep falling down from ear as the design is very poor. Sound quality is ok but my JBL speaker gives much higher quality than this.

The Boult Audio air-bass powerbuds was a good truly wireless Bluetooth device which we will get under this price range. The sound quality was absolutely nice at a volume of 70-80% and good at low volume and not bad at full volume. But I’m a person who always like to hear at low volume but at low volume the sound quality was nice but the bass quality was not as much good. At higher volumes, not bad. The touch sensitivity is absolutely nice and quickly responsive. Anyway the product is a good product but as compared to other substitutes the price is little high that’s the only and other kinetics was so nice.

Most of the things about this product is right like snug fit, decent battery life, sound quality, good bass but there are some cons to this product too, like  the sound quality during calling is not very good, ambient noise kind of takes over your voice and during gaming there us a minor latency which might cause a bad experience for many.But besides that everything looks more than fine.Overall if you want earbuds to listen to music, just go for it but if u want a earbud specific for calling, then look for other product.

First Boult purchase. Was skeptical when I purchased this but does a good job.Sound quality is good for price range. I can barely hear what is happening outside once i turn these on.Music sounds very good and has nice bass. This is comfortable on the ears, which is good for long duration phone calls.I have charged the unit after 17 days of purchase. my average use is around 2-2.5 hrs a day. So, has a very good battery lifeCons:Voice sounds robotic in ""Microsoft Teams"" calls on laptop and on phone.However, sounds better on phone(Airtel/Jio) calls.

Sound quality is upto the mark considering the price you get it at. Battery back up is above par with the case, you can carry it along in any trip without the need of carrying a charger for the case. The case in itself is a bit flimsy, the hinges of the case don't give you that satisfactory click on closing it, though the magnets inside holding the buds are really good and fits seemlessly, does not fall off with rigorous shaking too. Latency is low but does exist. Also the colour is a bit dull in comparison to the images provided. In all value for your buck.

Really satisfied with the product, specially considering the price range. Sound Quality is just fine with perfect noise cancellation. Although not as loud as I expected, the experience is quite optimal. Touch sensitivity and pairing could be a bit tricky to get used to, but it won't foil your experience with the earbuds much. All in all with the added feature of using the case as a battery backup for mobile devices makes it really worth the buy, especially if you get it in a lightning deal.Watch out for the size though!

The products meets the purpose..It has really good battery life..Sound quality is really good...The buds are waterproof..Fits properly in the ear( you have to find the right earbuds for your size)..The case is a bit bulky but considering the battery it hold..it can be ignored..The build quality of the product is really good..the plastics are sturdy and feels premium..

Pros: Very sensitive touch, Good quality sound., Mobile charging option. Long hrs standby and battery. Snug fit.Cons: Charge indicator lights inside the case. Case looks old, not premium look.

I must say the sound quality is cheap.Good enough for calls. The other person may not hear crisp sound of you talking but audible enough.Touch controls too sensitive hence its very irritating to use. Even sound on calls is very sharp and very unpleasant to the ears.Build quality is okay but in this price range cant expect more.Only big drawback is sound quality while listening to music. Do not buy is your purpose is both music and calls.For only calls it is good.

Been using this for a couple of months.Sometimes during call in a rush place voice wasn't clear for the other person.Comfort isn't good as per my expectations. After 2-3 hours  ears starts hurting.Else build quality, bass and sound quality is excellent. With good battery life, attractive look and good fiting.Value for each Penny.M satisfied with the product.

I am writing this review after use of 10days.This product is best in this price range.Special thing I like to mention here as mic quality and power backup which is fantastic.Bass quality is not bad, here expecting bit good quality of bass, but avarage quality of bass we get.Another things its well fitted in ear and come up with type C port, so don't have to carry  another cable.😀 .Overall powerbud are good.
"
3378,"
1) Bass is good.2) Battery life is good. I prefer disconnecting my mobile when not in use. Otherwise, batter would drain quickly.3) quickly connects. Even if you lost connection, quickly reconnects within a second.What's bad?1) Not good for calls when driving.2) navigating to next, previous, stop on touch while listening to music is little tough.

Good product. Audio quality and bass is good enough. The microphone quality was being on and off. Sometimes the person on the other side wouldnt be able to hear, even when the network quality was good. And also the auto pairing between both the earbuds dont happen automatically always(I have to put the buds back in the box and take em out again). Also it is good fit in the ear, and the battery backup is really good. Overall a good product to purchase, at this price range.

Boult Audio Powerbuds are Recommended because it has new addition of-1) Battery in case of 2200mah.2)Use of changing Lights Blue-White on Earbuds.3)One can use it as Power-Bank other than earbud charging case.And same features as in Boult Audio Truebuds-1) Instant wake-up pairing.2)5-6 hrs of working per single charge.3)Good Noise cancellation.Recommended!

Packaging- carefully packedLook- stylish and comfortableSound- clear sound of beats and lyricsControls- touch controls are a bit sensitiveBattery- I used the power buds for 4-5 days at gym after which I had to charge them. So I would say good battery backup.

The sound quality is crisp and clear with a minor bass. So mostly it's suitable for long calls. It has a impeccable battery backup with full day usage. Just charge once along with case and don't worry about charging for 3-4 days.

1) Sound quality good (value for money)2) Touch controls awesome (takes little time for us to adjust with touch sensitivity)3) battery backup good4) Littlebit latency is there while playing game.. however that can be tolerated.5) colour shown in product is little different than the actual product.6) the box quality is good but the lid feels little loose which makes me a little uncomfortable7) Best thing is noise cancellation....
"

Sound quality is average i.e. bass is not so good. There is latency while gaming so bad for gaming. Connectivity is on fire 🔥. Just take out from the case n it will connect instantly. Good. There is some mic issue in call sometimes. Playback time with the inbuilt battery of the case is very impressive but buds only is average.

pros:- Sound- Battery backup- Bluetooth range- Noise cancellation- connectivity ( i use it both on pc and phone and at-max it takes 5sec to switch)Cons:- size is a bit bulky which is uncomfortable for long use initially but with the time you will get comfortable with it.- touchpad is very sensitiveVerdict: go for it at this price ( I got it at Rs. 2399). I would rate 4.5/5 star

Pros-The sound quality and the bass quality is great.-It has decent noise cancellation.-The battery back is exceptionally good.-Good build qualityCons-The mic is not that great, the sound reaching the other person is distorted.-The bluetooth doesn't disconnect automaticallyy when we plave the pods in side the case. We have to manually disconnect it on the phone. Otherwise it will remain connected.

At this price point mny other makers are providing top notch features and performance driven devices where Boult fails.I really don't like it due to it fall down every now and then.
"

Design and sound of the product is good for music however if you are looking for a product for calls related tasks then this is not the best product as noise cancellation is not that good virtue of this product.Also if there is a problem with your product you will have to send the product to some location to claim warranty. My issue got resolved after reaching to customer care.Music and sound quality is decent, no doubt about it.
"
3395,"
These are great for calls, as they pair quickly. However, for music the sound is quite sharp. I couldn't listen to more than 10 minutes of music even after equalising sound on my phone. The 2 big USPs: they can be used individually for calls and the box doubles as emergency power bank for your phone. Not a bad deal for Rs. 2500.
"
3396,"
Liked the overall look. Case is too big. Can't pause/play audio easily with the button in this earbud. If I put my ear against the pillow while wearing this earbuds, it hurts more than my previous earbuds from another company. Audio quality is not as great as my previous earbuds, although I purchased both of them at the same price. Noise cancellation is also not as good as my previous earbuds.
"

Wow! It is awesome at this price point really I like it very much it is having a good sound quality and impressive noise cancellation and Bluetooth range is also good it has awesome battery backup and yes it is also having a power bank for emergency it is made of great build quality so don't see it just go for it and enjoy with this earbuds Thankyou to Boult making such a budget friendly product

I've used this product for just over two days and I can say that it has one of the best sound bass and audio quality, for the price point these truly wireless earpods are defenitely the best I've yet to charge the case even once been using it straight of the package for 2 days straight. The best feature is the touch on the side which works with ease and not mentioning the impressive range( I've used it to workout in a seperate room when my phone was charging in the living room) would be a disservice. Overall I would say the best product available in this price range.

If you want to switch from ordinary wired headphones to these wireless earbuds, you are not gonna disapoint. Sound is clear and bass is average. Overall experience is about ok ok✌

The product worked good initially. I love the bass but you have to compensate for the voice quality. My right earphone started glitching and the touch pad stopped working.

I have written a wrong review as a customer care executive have asked me to write as my ear buds are not working properly. She said the if I will give a good review as well as if I give rating as 4/5 then they will exchangey product. But after writing a good review also nothing has happened. Please guys don't trust these people moreover the product is also not good.
"

The battery life is amazing and more than what I could have asked for. The sound quality and build quality of the product are also apt. I have been told that the ear buds can also be used in the shower without a problem. The product lacks a little when it comes to mic quality and the touch sensors are a little troublesome to operate but at this price this is by far the best product out there. I would go as far to say that this would be a better product than those costing twice the amount.

battery life is excellent...i had received the product on friday 15aug and i charged it once on the day of delivery and still it is fully charged and works excellent....talking about sound quality- it is good but when you increase the sound above 90% then it will create pain in your ears but below 90% the sound quality is good...and noise cancellation feature is above average but it could be better- on roads you have to speak louder then normal but it works perfect in room environment... OVERALL PRODUCT IS AWESOME AT THE GIVEN PRICE..I GOT THEM ON SALE @2500.

Like the product but one thing is likely to be unfair that today's deal is 300 rs less than yesterday.How many times we got not chance..Bass quality should be increased with loudness..

Best earbud in the market. Sound quality is outstanding and noise cancellation is also pretty desent. Bass is superb as well as earbuds are very comfortable. The most important thing is that the 155 hours playtime. Once the earbuds are fully charged, it will not discharge for a week. Overall, outstanding earbuds at this price!

Well the pairing of Bluetooth with mobile is seamless, as soon as u open the case it get automatically paired with the last paired device. The fit is good and it doesn't falls while doing sudden movement and running. Sound is crisp clear and bass is good. And the charging case of the pods can be used as a reverse battery pack for mobile.

I find this product quite great in terms of Voice quality, noise cancelation and comfort that it offers. Excellent choice in this price range. Battery backup is good enough.

Just basic wireless earphones.

Reviewing it after 2nd day of delivery. There is no active noise cancellation. Bass was poor. Sound quality some what okey . Case material was not good enough.

when i get the product, the charging case is missing but the earbuds are charged 80%.so I using the earbuds and you can't believe whole day start at 8:00 am and direct stop at 4:00 pm but the earbuds battery is 10%. I am very impressed with the battery of earbuds and base is awesome but there is only one problem that's the touch area is at deep point that's why our finger can't reach at accurate touch point . Means the touch control little weak

The noise cancellation is great. The product finish is good. Looks great by appearance. The sound quality is also quite good at this price.

My first Boult product and absolutely loved it. The sound quality is fantastic, though if you enjoy heavy bass, you may think otherwise. Pairs super easily and with zero hassle. The charging case is very well designed and ensures a snug fit. Speaking of fit, the Powerbuds fit comfortably and with little to no discomfort. Play/Pause and taking calls is effortless. Have yet to use voice assistant function so not sure how well that works. Overall, a value for money and well designed product.

It won't fit in all ears. And buds itself feels heavy and big. And trouble press and not works at all. And double touch only works on some times. Most faulty piece for this price.But sound looks good. And noise cancel works 70% only.

Was using a Sony XB75AP before and am satisfied with the change.The earbuds are a bit bulky, so those with small ears might face issues.The bass is not overwhelming, but that's a good thing in my view.The sound is crisp and I personally couldn't hear any tear or noise while using it.So, if you have the budget, these can definitely be considered.

This product doesn't work for callingThere is no noise cancellation instead it is cancelling your own voice, hence other side will not hear your voice at allPlease if you are buying it for calling purpose then don't go for this product.

Product is too bulky but price worthy, great for music, the bass and treble are well balnced to give a relatively good stereo experience, wouldn't feel noisy even at the high volume. Design is great too.. Do not buy it for the sake of calling, catches too much ambient noise.Overall, a good product.

Great sound is the only good thing about these earbuds. They are also extremely uncomfortable. Couldn't even wear them for half an hour. Furthermore, the lid of the charging case is a bit flimsy. The capacitive touch is so sensitive that it would wake google assistant any time I took the earphones out of my ear.PS-if you have somehow decided to buy these, go for the black ones since ""azure blue"" really looks terrible.
"
3455,"
Very average product for the price. The sound quality is decent but it cannot be used for taking calls as the other person cannot hear a thing. Also, not the biggest fan of the touch controls, it is too sensitive and sometimes when the bud is coming out of your ear, you cannot plug it in because a single touch will result in ending the call.The only positive is the battery life which lasts good 5-6 hours.
"

The sound is great for listening to music, there a small negative while taking a call, the opposite person is getting a low voice, apart from that everything is clear.

I got these earbuds for Rs 1999 when it was on sale, at this price range I'm happy with the sound quality. Bluetooth connectivity is good, it remains connected even I'm in another room. Seems there is only one microphone on the left side earbud, so for calling you might need to speak louder than usual or take out the left side earbud place it near your mouth for better voice recording.

This are probably best earbuds for people looking under 3k range.This earbuds got very good sound quality, good bass as it should be and best of all excellent battery life. For me this earbuds last around 4-4.5 hours and case last almost 110 hours.Since I have already used boult products so i bought them blindly and they are upto my expectations. Also they don't fall off from your ears so good for people who like jogging,running or working out.Thanks!!!!😁

The sound quality is great the bass is very good the noise cancelling is satisfactory. The buds are nice looking and fully functional. The case is bit bigger but it have really huge battery for a earbud and it can also be used as a power bank The mic quality is great and the whole product is very durable. Great product

Edit: Frequently disconnects if you use it with Zoom in PC. Not at all recommended for online class through PC. It works well with Zoom in Android though.Sound quality and connectivity is superb. Battery life is amazing. Call Quality and Noise cancellation is decent. Overall, satisfied with it. Value for Money product. Don't get misled by the negative reviews, go for it and you will surely not regret.

1. The box lid is sooo flimsy!! Dont know if its mine only or i am expecting much in this price range2. The mic is the first issue i am facing... Other person in call having very low voice and sometimes sound distortion !! Like a robotic sound with my voices3. Will try to sort it out  .. if not i will return it for sure
"

These powerbuds are good with nice sound quality, bass quality is also nice and perfect fit in ears, as mentioned the case can be used for reverse charging of mobile.Both the buds have Microphone which is one of the advantage.But the major problem is only with the touch control, if ur finger touches accidentally music pauses or call will end

Their is nothing i can say is bad about this product, i use it for 3 4 weeks without charging, good noise, u can even take calls using one earbud, and person before can listen u in silent place in noise place calling fets hard.

 It has been a few days now since I've brought the earbuds, I just love the sound quality and the noise cancellation! IPX7 waterproofing is just an added advantage! I faced an issue wherein the buds sometimes do not pair with each other, but then it was rectified with just a reset! It fits perfectly in the ear and doesn't fall off!

Fir those who like soft sound quality. 2200 mah battery case. There is only one con that is at outside area.. receiver hear so much noise if you take call at some crowded area or at less crowded area.Other wise it's awesome all features whih are mentioned in manual are there and working so good.Love you team boult great work.

Sound quality in these earphones are amazing. The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy. ... These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features. If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.

First I conneced with this buds I a m very disappointed with the sound and quality of bass  but after using it for 2days I changed some settings in my mobile and connected now it is outstanding I was surprised after changing setting i also have apple airpords pro the quality is same compared to both with buying in this budget

It's a wonderful product in this range of price. It's sound quality is marvelousWith a great Bass. Only point which I don't like about is it's size of buds they go to much derp in my ear And to big in size. But rather then that every thing is just best . Most amazing feature we got is it's battery life it take you 24 cycles of charging the pods with the case to finish it.

It's a decent product, but major problem was disconnection by single touch  during a ongoing conversation. Similarly when on a VoIP/WhatsApp call, the single touch resulted in switching on music during the call. Touching is required coz after few minutes of usage or the buds in ears, it's required to adjust or it starts itching, for which intermittent touching is needed resulting in the above problems.

A decent earbuds from Boult, with average base and noise cancellations.High volume seems to be better than low and mid volumes.Overall a good pacakage with this price..If u a bass lover then I would recommend not to choose this , because it has a moderate bass..And one of the major con for me is with longer duration I am feeling irritation on my ears since its size is quite bulky.

Boult Airbass Powerbuds are truly amazing at the price. It has amazing sound quality and designed ergonomically to perfectly fit in the ears.

Sound and bass quality is very good. Company do not provide touch volume control function in new models. Earlier, in old models it was provided by company. One can't see the level of battery of charging case without opening the case. This all are minor cons. Rest all are good. Value for money.

One of the best Bang for the buck earbuds I've ever purchased. The bass is punchy and the mids are clear. Bass lovers will love the purchase. I'm a regular user of the buds and It's been a week since i charged my earbuds. The size is a bit on the bigger side but fits perfectly in my ear. Gaming latency is way lower compared to to other earbuds in this segment.
"

If your requirement is making hands free call, you must stay away from this product. There is no noise cancellation for microphone as a result the caller on other side heard lift off background noise and can't hear the main voice clearly.Music hearing with bass and all is good. But long time  in ear is painful and not very comfortable.

This product is quite good from a sound perspective. Excellent sound quality and coverage are also good. However, it's mic is not effective. In fact, it can't be used for calls due to poor mic. As my primary goal was to pick it for good quality sound in this price range so went for it.

I have been using it for the last few months and I am completely satisfied with the product. Very good sound quality and best in the class battery backup. I just recharge once in a 1.5 month. Though I didn't use it for mobile charging, i hope it's a very good alternative as emergency mobile charger.

Purchased it and got it delivered in time. Was working good on iphone, was facing issues with Oneplus nord. Raised a complaint and they got it replaced. The battery backup of the case is excellent. Don't remeber when I hadast charged it and still it's shwing 100%. Barring the noise cancellation, everything is perfect

The powerbuds work perfectly fine, with crystal clear sound quality. Took away a star because it automatically disconnects for no apparent reason and reconnects after placing the buds in the case and restarting.

This product is worth 2200, i will highly recommend this product in this range, as it is having amazing battery, bass quality, also with good noise cancellation and the main part there is no issue in connectivity. Ifyou can compromise on size of the earphone case then this is the best ever earphone i have ever experienced.

Using this more than 6 months. This device is good for its battery and also sound quality is not bad, but if you want it also for calling purpose it's a bad option definitely. Sometimes it gives connectivity problems as well.  So i think it's an average product -3/5.

Nice earphones for the price. Battery is excellent, haven't charged it for a long long time. Bass is pretty good. Sound quality is also excellent.Not so happy with the noise cancellation because that also is a promised feature, but overall at ~2300 rupees, this is nice.

After sale service is very very poor. This earbud mic stopped working in just 2-3 weeks of purchase scensors don't work properly after complain they are saying you have to courier them and we will repair it ....just after buying the product you get the product repaired not replaced this is the quality of the product .
"
3614,"
After using more than 1 month, I will give it 2 star. The basic problem with this is that when you are in call, the other person is unable to hear you, even you are taking in high pitch. Sound disturbance is also an issue along with connection.

Working is very good, fingerprints works good.But it is very large in size. It supporting reverse charge support.But I clearly tell you guys very large in size. I return it.

The sound quality for such small buds is too amazing. Perfectly fits the ear and once your start playing your favourite music, it's a complete isolation from the outside world, thanks to the noise cancellation. The case for the buds is good, the 2 way charging feature is something unheard of in the product of this category. Go for it without a doubt.

All in all good earphones for this price range. 1 less star just because of the mic. You have to speak really loud for the mic to work. I only use these while working out (good fit, didn't fall of even while running on the treadmill and skipping) or while in the office.

Audio quality and surrounding are very good. Also the audio quality and noise cancellation are good. But it is not active noise cancellation. So some surrounding sound will be audible.

I am a novice in this domain, so don't expect technical details in my review.Honestly speaking, this is my first pair of wireless earphones (or earpods) and to get something as cool looking at this is totally worth the wait and money. I have never been too comfortable shifting to wireless earphones for the fear of losing them. I enjoyed unboxing the earpods and showing them off to my near and dear ones (got a few jealous eyes on my earpods).I can say that the sound quality and comfort is really good cause I have used earpods owned by my friends and I never thought I could catch up to this trend cause they felt uncomfortable in my ear. I'm still getting used to the touch-sensitiven controls, but I'm loving the fact that it connects automatically and hasn't once been disconnected because of bad network. I have sometimes gone out of range, but the moment I come back within range the earpods just pop back to life.PS: I have a few envious people who have spent more on their earpods and haven't really fallen in love with them (too bad for them). I got this beauty for a handsome price tag of 1999 INR (Perks of being a Prime user, isn't it!).

Ordered on 8th of Aug, got 1st Delivery on 10th Which was 2 days before Expected delivery, but product was damaged, no bass, no clear sound and calls are just worst,  so I made a replacement and got another product today (11th of aug) this time I got a good product , Music quality is OK, but not up to mark, sometime sound like the cheap TWS available with in 1000, but call quality is still worst.GOOD ThingsBuild QualityTYPE C-PortEar Fit is also goodFor me it was not so comfortable, but it depend on our ear size
"
4004,"
Got Mine Delivered today after the order being placed on the 7th of August.everyone has given good pros, but I have some cons that are sort of important to consider.Cons - 1) Audio captured from the mic is low and it sounds like I am sitting in a Bathroom.  a) Memo, b) call  2) Touch sensors are not intuitive nor fast, Also they get activated when the upper or side area of the boom is touched.  3) The presence of bass is a bit lacking.  4) There is a noticeable delay in audio when we are playing Pubg. Not so discernable during Netflix.  5) Sound quality is affected by the Type of Ear Tip used, Found better sound with Mi tips.  6) The real use of TWS for ease of taking calls, if that is not attenable then Neckband of Oneplus Bullets and or Samsung level u / pro is a far better option to buy, I know it is not TWS but the price range and quality make a difference.

Well it promises extra Bass but I can't feel it. This seems more like a 500 rupees earphone in Pods, even the 500 rupees earphone sounds better that this.

Effectively one of the best TWS in this market place more battery life than other buds in this range. Sharper sound which stands out also the quality of phone calls is okay. One lagging though though it's some time take time to realize the phone's bluethooth. Not sure about the how to avail  warranty for the product. Cuz of not well established service center in India, I think it's going to be a hassle.Overall I'm all for this bud.

I am a novice in this domain, so don't expect technical details in my review.Honestly speaking, this is my first pair of wireless earphones (or earpods) and to get something as cool looking at this is totally worth the wait and money. I have never been too comfortable shifting to wireless earphones for the fear of losing them. I enjoyed unboxing the earpods and showing them off to my near and dear ones (got a few jealous eyes on my earpods).I can say that the sound quality and comfort is really good cause I have used earpods owned by my friends and I never thought I could catch up to this trend cause they felt uncomfortable in my ear. I'm still getting used to the touch-sensitiven controls, but I'm loving the fact that it connects automatically and hasn't once been disconnected because of bad network. I have sometimes gone out of range, but the moment I come back within range the earpods just pop back to life.PS: I have a few envious people who have spent more on their earpods and haven't really fallen in love with them (too bad for them). I got this beauty for a handsome price tag of 1999 INR (Perks of being a Prime user, isn't it!).

I brought this propods form my son. The quality of these pods are very good and sound quality, wireless connectivity is also great. Initially there were some technical glitches in the volume of pods.I sent it to the service centre as instructed by Boult.They sent a new replacement within few days.The current one is working absolutely fine .

Ordered on 8th of Aug, got 1st Delivery on 10th Which was 2 days before Expected delivery, but product was damaged, no bass, no clear sound and calls are just worst,  so I made a replacement and got another product today (11th of aug) this time I got a good product , Music quality is OK, but not up to mark, sometime sound like the cheap TWS available with in 1000, but call quality is still worst.GOOD ThingsBuild QualityTYPE C-PortEar Fit is also goodFor me it was not so comfortable, but it depend on our ear size

Got Mine Delivered today after the order being placed on the 7th of August.everyone has given good pros, but I have some cons that are sort of important to consider.Cons - 1) Audio captured from the mic is low and it sounds like I am sitting in a Bathroom.  a) Memo, b) call  2) Touch sensors are not intuitive nor fast, Also they get activated when the upper or side area of the boom is touched.  3) The presence of bass is a bit lacking.  4) There is a noticeable delay in audio when we are playing Pubg. Not so discernable during Netflix.  5) Sound quality is affected by the Type of Ear Tip used, Found better sound with Mi tips.  6) The real use of TWS for ease of taking calls, if that is not attenable then Neckband of Oneplus Bullets and or Samsung level u / pro is a far better option to buy, I know it is not TWS but the price range and quality make a difference.

One of the TWS in the marketI will now provide you the reason why I have rated this product as 4 star.1) The pricing is very fair (It competes to TWS which are around 4-5K).2) Controls are awesome, lots of options (However controls are very sensitive and sometimes it's a hit or a miss but overall 80% it's a hit).3)The Case if of plastic earphones comes in a snug fit once you put it in your ears then it won't fall.4) The best feature and the highlight of this product, Since both the earphones are master earphones, therefore it kinda gives you ear detection (eg if you are wearing both the earphones and if you remove one then that earphone will swith off its volume, and it will resume once you put it back into your ears)5) Works well with Google assistant, had no problems with it6) Microphone is clear and the caller gets your crisp voice.Now I will tell you the reason why it didn't got additional 1 star.1) No dual microphone, so it's a passive noise cancellation.(there will be noise if you are in a buzzing street)2) Even though it's Bluetooth 5.0 but not recommended for gaming, you can use it for PBUG but there is a lag of 0.2-0.6 seconds (Which is critical when someone is firing a Kar98K or AWM)3) The case feels plastic but thr mat finish gives it a good look but the opening is a bit loose, you will have to take care while opening or closing the case (However not recommended if you have a habit to drop stuff)ConclusionOverall the prouduct is very good for its price range.Price - 5/5Sound - 4/5Gaming - 3/5Earphones Quality - 4/5Charging - 4/5Built quality - 3/5Noise Cancellation - 3/5Controls-4/5Working with AI-4/5Value for money - 5/5

Everything except the call quality and support is great.The design is just awesome.Its great for music. You will get an above average bass and the sound is clear.The battery backup is also good.Its supports AAC, which is far better than the common SBC...When i bought it, it was mentioned in the description that it supports APTX.But after a couple of days of ordering it, they removed it.So no APTX support.I don't understand how people are able to make calls on this.On calls the propods has a mind of its own.Sometimes its okay and the rest of the times its bad. There is no scenario where you get good calls with this propods.On calls, If you need the other person to hear you loudly, you will have to shout.Its the same if you are using it with single ear or both.For calls, you need a closed room to shout.You cannot use it on an office environment.Also there is this issue of call drops. Around 50% of the time, call drops.These issues are the same for the second propods which i got as a replacement.Now comes the golden part... THE SUPPORTIts better to buy it at your own risk.... Just like buying something without warranty.I tried contacting Boult support through calls and the support form on their website.I waited for 10days... No reply... So basically you will be paying Rs2000(Now Rs2500) for a product without warranty.With all these issues, i did settle for a neckband rather than a TWS.I bought a OnePlus Bullets Z wireless.Its far superior and feature packed.

Sound quality was good, but noise cancellation is just a crap. This product is not good for calls. The fit is okay bit it is quite big for a small or average ears. Build quality is good where it looks really rich and polished for this price. It is certainly light weighr. Overall if you are just buying it to listen to music you can go ahead otherwise for calls it's not worth it. I'm returning my product and I'm requesting the seller for a refund as I need my tws mainly for calls.

The sound quality is good for it's price. I bought this for both calls as well as listening to music. The sound quality when playing music is good for earbuds at this price point although I have not used it for extensive listening - barely 2 ro 3 songs at a time since this was primarily purchased for calls during WFH - (for music I have a Bose wireless which is excellent). The Boult is a huge let down as far as calls are concerned - the bluetooth cuts off in the middle of calls - sometimes just one of the earbuds cuts off -  it is a mess. On top of it, the battery barely lasts 2 hours - nowhere close to the 4 hours that is touted.

I was using Boult Curve Neckband for almost an year and was over satisfied with the gadget. So I ordered these ProPods trusting the brand, and satisfied with the music quality and battery backup. But however my friends started complaining that they can’t hear me properly on calls even if I’m sitting in a closed room. I think this could have been better.Pros:1. Snug fit - These pods comes with 3 sets of ear plugs so change your ear plugs according to your size2. Good Battery - I recharge the case once for 3 days, of course I use these 5-6hrs a day3. Decent Sound Quality - The buds performance is good while listening to music or watching a movie4. No lag - Using these buds from past 2 weeks, I didn’t find any lag in the audio so farCons:1. Disturbance - The other party on the call complained that they are getting lot of disturbance when I was using these buds for calls. I tried using left/right/both combinations but didn’t help. I even tried these buds in a closed room for calls but still in vain. I didn’t get a chance to take these buds to test noise cancellation

Not a bad build quality for the price, feels a little cheap, that's only because you're paying only 2000rs for a wireless type c charging bluetooth earphones.But the pairing process is horrendous when it comes to pairing the two earphones to each other, it works really well just pairing to a device but pairing to each other is a hit and miss.Sound quality is good. Blanaced. Voice calls are also good.Switching between devices like your phone and laptop is also horrible because of the pairing issue.I would've been okay with all of this and enjoyed the device if only I could get in touch with their customer care.Couldn't even talk to anyone, tried over 10 times, hence I'm returning these.

Pros--Sound quality is good 4/5⭐-Battery is an excellent 4.5 hr avg. Per single charge and including case it's about 20 hr.- Build quality is also good 5/5⭐- Decent for calling at this price range. U can easily hear the opposite person's voice.Cons--As per mentioned it has low latency mode but it's not working for my OnePlus 5, I faced a sound delay issue for gaming (pubg). So I've not recommended for gaming.-Sometimes it's a disconnected call during calls.-it has a little bit of low audioOverall it's a good product. Go for it. And support Indian products.🇮🇳

I 1st order this product by being mesmerised by the price and the design of the earbuds and the features they offered.but the 1st time I ordered the earbuds they got defected . God knows how. the problem was they sometimes were not connected properly. Or sometimes there was a lag between the phone and the earbuds. it was all ok if I reconnect it a couple of times but one day it was just sitting on the table and all of it became permanent. and please note this happened in within 10 days {the replacement period}so I decided to replace it, thinking it was a defective piece. and I didn't think about it much too much.now I ordered it a 2nd time.All is well, I just used it and put it in its case to charge a little, then out of nowhere something happened to it and its not connecting with the Bluetooth, not even showing on my phone, not on any other phone either. I checked it was charged properly I also rebooted my phone couple of time nothing is working. and do note this happened within the 10 days{the replacement time}and the worst part of it I cannot replace it or get my refund back. The worst use of rs2500 ever. this is a wast of money.

I don't understand why this product has so many good reviews. This product is as average as any other Chinese TWS trying to prove thier worth but Trust me these as basic as others.Yes in some cases these performs a little better than others but still I feel the fame is fake.Anyways coming to the review. First Things which I think are better than other Chinese TWSCall quality (These seems to have a bit better call handling capabilities, I have tried calls while on bike (with helmet on) the person heard me properly but I was speaking loudly as well. I have tried in quiet room and they did good, I have tried in a noisy room with 5-6 peps around and they fail to cancel any noise the other person could hear everyone's voice)USB Type C charging ( I know almost all latest TWS are coming with Type C but still the majority are on Micro USB so it's good for them and can be considered better)Lid closing snap (Trust me it's so satisfying, I am not sure how much damage will it do in a longer run but it's good)Touch controls (I really like the touch response on the stem it's a bit sensitive but I like it )Things I think which are at par with other TWSSound (music) it's as similar to othersFit and comfort it's as similar to any other rubber tip style ear budsEverything else you can think are mediocreThings which are lower than othersWhen earbuds are inside of the case and upon shaking there is a little sound like something is banging on the side walls and it seems the earbuds don't sit flush in the case.When I say Chinese TWS, I consider all TWS available like Boat, Noise, Mi, Redmi, Realms, OnePlus and etc

I bought it in great Indian sale and I got it at very decent price (Below 2K). After using this I must say, it’s best in segment in this price.  I did a lot of research before buying it and no other earbuds at this price point offer the same quality which Boult Probuds are providing. Superb design with good build quality and awesome sound.Build Quality: Build quality is very nice, gives you a premium look in matt finish. Touch is also very responsive, It securely fits in your ear.Sound Quality: Clear sound quality with above-average bass quality, loudness is balanced, not so high, not so low. Good for music.Calling: I haven’t used outside on streets but for indoor, best in the segment call quality, noise cancellation is average.Battery: Average 3-4 hours as per your usageOverall I am very satisfied with the product, I haven’t faced any problem yet. So, a very good product at very good price.

Good = Form factor, in 2.5k INR (10% cost) you get the convenience/feel of Apple AirPods.Bad = Call quality. Bass.Ugly = Touch controls, imagine they are not there because they won’t work. Bluetooth Pairing, switching from one device to other is not easy.Buy it for only true wireless comfort/convenience with average or decent sound quality.DON’T BUY FOR OTHER NEEDS (SOUND, BASS, TOUCH, CALLS).I liked it because I use it only on few occasions which require true wireless convenience and I am ok to use with phone controls (not touch).

For the first 3-4 weeks they worked fine. But from last 2 weeks one of the ear  piece is not working properly. Even it is not charging. I have raised a complaint for the same. Hopefully the team will resolve this issue ASAP.The issue got resolved. Although, They don’t have a pickup service for the faulty pods. I had to send the pods to their Delhi office and they don’t refund the courier cost.All-in-all not satisfied with the after sale service. Being such a big company (as per their advertisement), they must provide a pickup service also. What’s the use of online sell when they send a faulty piece and then expect the customer to pay more just to get the item repaired.Won’t be ordering again for sure. And won’t recommend it to anyone.There are other brands with better products and after sell services.Also just to add the pods are not comfortable after an hour of continuous use. My ears started aching.27/04- Yesterday got a call from the company and they were literally forcing me to remove this review and give them atleast 3 stars. That is how bad the company is.They were adamant about this.I got almost 5-6 calls and they just pleaded to remove the review and the customer care representative told me that if I don’t remove the review then this will impact her job.22/8/2021 - The battery is not working now at all. Within 5 mins it drains out completely and the pods turn off.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AT ALL.1/8/2021- The company representative keeps calling and asks to delete this review. Today he called and asked to remove this review and then only they will repair or replace my defective pro pods. If I don’t delete this review then they will not provide me with any help although the product is still under warranty.

I was looking frantically for a TWS which should be good for calls and I can guarantee users who are looking for a TWS primarily for phone calls/con calls/google meet calls, just close your eyes and get this. I am using this with my iPhone X, it's good for AudioBooks & Music but bad for Videos. Despite it's named, ProBass, there is minimal bass. I love songs with more vocals & instruments, so this is fine with me. But the sound is too low while playing videos even at the max volume. I have played both MP4 and MKV files using Apple TV and VLC.I have been listening a AudioBook for the last 2 hours, looking at the consumption, I believe this will give around 4 hours for Audio and 3 hours for 720p video. Will update my review within a couple of days.Finally, the feel is not premium, this is cheap plastic from every point, the buds are light but feels cheap. The box too is very light but no premium feel. I am using the default eartips, despite it's not falling down but the right pod feels tad loose.So, the verdict, TWS for 2399, if you need wireless calls, just go for this one.Thanks Amazon. Well done Boult.Hope my review helps in making purchase decisions correctly.

Amazing pods at this price point, bought the white ones and it looks stylish.The pods are working absolutely fine, I was hesitant at first to buy because there were no reviews and I had already researched a lot on pods so went for this. It does not disappoint. At the price point of 2k you are actually getting everything which you could ask for.Pros:1. Awesome sound quality. I see some of the reviews stating sound is low. Actually it depends upon which music player you are using. I used a music player which was from playstore and sound was little low but when I played songs on my Amazon Music aap BOOM sound is amazing with perfect bass and perfect mids and lows. So try changing music app it will work.2. Call quality is also good.  Call is cristal clear on the other side and no lags found.3. Battery is also awesome will update more on battery when I use it more extensively.4. Design and Comfort is amazing it fits perfectly in my ear and does not fall.5. Connectivity is also great does not disconnect when you move far. The auto pairing feature is amazing it just pairs automatically once you pull the pods out.Cons:Yet to find one.Will update the review after 1 week of extensive usage.My Verdict- Dont give second thought, just go for it and you will not regret.

I come from AirPods Pro and wanted something the same for Android, so I find the touch functionality a little out of my personal sync and habit. The volume up and down requiring a 5-sec press is very annoying for me. However, everything else is great, instant pairing and audio is clear. Bass is average.I found the pairing on iOS works better as far volume controls is concerned and we can see visual audio level, while on Android even after turning max volume on phone, I need to turn-up volume using the earpiece. Not sure if its device specific, but audio visual level is a boon.

27-Nov-2021: After spending lot of time and energy in follow-up, received replacement in August and come November the new pods failed again. They have now stopped charging. What a waste of time and money. Never ever buying a Boult product.19-Apr-2021: Rating reverted to 1 star (Can't makeit ZERO)!!! After 1 week of interactions with the support team I now realise why #Boult product are faulty. Pick-up was to happen on 12-Apr. Gave a reminder to Boult Support on 13-Apr and they raised a reverse pick-up ticket on 15-Apr. Received email on 17-Apr with my address mentioned as Fatehpur, Uttar Pradesh while I stay in Maharashtra - hence called immediately on 17-Apr and I was assured that my address has been corrected. Today, 19-Apr, I receive a call from the pick-up guys from Fatehpur!!! I call the Boult Support again and explained them that they had erroneously mentioned wrong address. But the support team executive had the temerity to mention that the address was provided by me and that she had my details mentioned in her notebook...really!!!. God only knows what system they use for processing complaints!!!10-Apr: Received a pro-active call from Boult team for replacement of the defective product. Raised a support ticket for replacement of the product. Hoping for quick action. Increased the rating to 3 for the team's responsiveness.Reduced further to 1 star due to poor sound quality and continuous disturbance during phone calls. Only able to use it for listening to music.It's a decent product for the price point received. Comfortable to use for a couple of hours. Music quality is decent. Battery life is good. Overall meets expectations.Update: lot of static sound and also cracking noises during calls. Ok for hearing music.

A new product to take a risk on without reviews. But brand name ofcourse was enough to make the choices. A very good product with perfect hold on ears even if you're doing any physical activity. Sound quality and noise cancellation is upto the mark. Economical air pods.Only con is the bass is a bit on the lower side. But if you're not a bass lover a perfect chooce for you.

Its been 3 months since a return/support has been initiated. not worth the money nor time.Interesting some agent from Boult Audio team called telling to open Amazon, and give them a 5 Star review and share the screenshot with them on WhatsApp, it sounded more like a credit card or PhonePe scammer asking to share your card details or click on a link they shared.If this is happening with the knowledge of Boult Audio, it's unethical and unprofessional to increase business using these cheap tactics.Well, im still waiting for someone legit from Amazon or Boult to respond to my service/return request, wish me luck !!

In-Short: I had worst experience with their product and Customer Service. Think twice even before thinking to buy these products; Save your Money, Time and Peace of mind..I purchased Boult Propods in the month of Jan 2021, Then I found issue with calling Calling quality, Initially I thought this is network issue then realized that this is product issue. Then I had raised request 000XXXX, Then I had to courier this product to Delhi office. Then after many follow-ups I got WRONG PRODUCT DELIVERY 2 TIMES of Freepods instead Propods, So again they asked to send this product by courier then I will get reimbursements. So far I still second courier reimbursement is pending from Boult despite of sending all invoice details and many follow-ups. Then after few follow-ups I got finally delivery of correct Propods.Then after few days of usage of Propods again it got an issue, Then I have raised new complaint 00xxxx on 1st June 2021, But still the date I didn't received any replacement.So since purchase over 6 months, It wasted almost 4 months in replacement process. THIS IS COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY, TIME and PEACE OF MIND. Boult customer service is very pathetic which causes lots of frustration.

This is my first TWS. After doing some research, I found that Boult range of products are good. First impressions, the earpods look great. The connectivity is fast. Sound quality is good. Vocals are clear. At first, I was not impressed with bass quality. Thought to return them. But later, when I switched between different bud sizes, I felt the bass effect and it is really good. Right fit makes the difference. Large buds fit my ear. For 1999, these are worth it if you consider TWS. But you can have lot of options if you consider wired headsets in the same budget. Boult didn't disappoint me.Things which impress you:1. Light and comfortable fit. You don't feel irritated even after long usage.2. Crisp audio quality with clear vocals and sounds.3. Call quality is good without any issues4. Volume control feature which you don't see in many other TWS in this budget.Things which might bother you:1. Above average bass.(you won't be disappointed though)2. Need to get used to touch controls. Manytimes, when I touched them to adjust, Google assistant wakes up.3. Carry case is shiny and not matty. Can get scratches over time.

 I would keep my review simple and to the point.1) bought this for 19992) the build quality is good and won't hurt your ears3) won't fall off easily and fits well4) did not try pairing with 2 device5) volume is good, not very loud6) bass is a bit on the lower side7) call quality is good8) but when on a call don't touch the earpods as it disconnects the call with the slightest of the touch9) volume control feature is useless as u need to hold for more than 5 secs10) battery back up is good11) connects seamlessly and does not disconnect (this is one problem that I noticed on one plus buds)12) does the job well13) cannot comment on after sale service as this is just 2 days old when I reviewed.14) will update my review after sometime15) Unlike other earpods, this does not pause music when you remove these from your ears.16) stops abruptly and you need to reset it everytime17) support /repairs only done in the Gurgaon and no local support availableI've used this for almost a year and have multiple issues. They don't have a local support you need to send your product to them for any repair. Though I liked this product earlier I won't recommend this product now due to the issues it has.

Negatives: Sound quality is good if you are NOT looking for bass, surrounds, dolby, stereo etc. The overall experience of watching a movie (or even a video) gets compromised if you cannot enjoy the special sound effects. I do like balanced sound, but this is not balanced as it completely lacks bass. Other than bass, the high and medium are well captured.Positives: Connectivity is exceptionally good. The build quality of the earphones is good (won't say the same for the case, as it seems flimsy). This is the best fitting earphone I have ever had. It is semi in the ear not fully in the ear, so you can wear it for hours together.Verdict: I am still returning it because of lack of bass. Bass seems to be the primary reason why I am not able to enjoy these earbuds.

Full Review after 3 days of usageLooks: This one definitely wins over the other looks-wise. It looks better than others in the market and other models in Boult. The earbuds have a very premium feel to them and the finish is great both on the case as well as the earbuds. The magnet works very well on the box and for charging and they won't drop out of the box if you hold them upside down. The case has 4 led lights which indicate charging levels and status. There are also small LEDs on earphones as well but they only blink when they are not connected to anything and available to pair and thankfully never other than that. I dislike any sort of lights on the earpods itself but glad this is not a problem.Connectivity: They are available for pairing immediately as you take them out of the box. I haven't faced any connectivity issues so far. I have been using them with both my phone and laptop. So, when I take them out of the case and they have both options available like my phone and laptop, then they connect to the last device before they went in the case if only one device is available they connect directly to that. And as the description mentions, they are dual masters and can be used independently or together.Battery: The earbuds once fully charged offers just about 4 hours in continuous usage. However, they seem to last all day if you are using intermittently with breaks in between but have them on your ears. I haven't measured the exact time but they charge fairly quickly once inside the box. About 10-15 min is enough for them to last 2 hours. I noticed that the battery discharges quicker when you use them for calls rather than music or you connect to a laptop for watching a TV series or something but I guess that's true for any earbuds. Overall you get a little over 20-22 hours of usage with a fully charged case. The case takes about 1.5-2 hours to charge and uses a Type-C charger. I would like higher battery life, but they give as much as promised, so can't complain there.Usage: The touch quality is fine but super sensitive. Sometimes when I am adjusting my earphones or properly mounting them in the ear it switched on google assistant/Cortana. Also sometimes the call gets disconnected when you try and adjust the earphones so that's annoying. All the touch gestures work as they are supposed to and the triple tap, double-tap, everything works as shows in the pictures. The rubber tips on the earbuds are smaller than usual, not very small but smaller than the medium size tips of other brands but they provide replacement tips in the box in a bigger size so that's not an issue.Call/Music Quality: So, coming to the most important part, the music quality is satisfactory, its obviously not like Bose or any other premium brands but the quality is definitely as good as normal wired earphones in the same range. I used more expensive tws earbuds from boat before this and boult is a definite improvement at a lesser price. You can download any of the apps on play store to enhance music and though you can feel the improvement after using any app (but that's true for any earbuds you use), it is really not necessary and increasing the bass manually will drain the battery. So, for a normal user who is not very fixated on trying to get that studio-quality music but just a casual listener, these work just fine. Coming to the calls, the mic works well and the other person can hear you clearly. Though they mention passive noise cancellation, it hardly works. There is a difference with noise cancellation but not as much as you'd like.Impressive Points:The design of the earphonesSeamless connectivityCons:I would've preferred a better noise cancellation.The super-sensitive touch is annoying especially during calls if I touch it to adjust and it disconnects.So, overall I would rate them as 4.5/5 but I am going to give them 5 stars since 4 is not warranted.

Sound is good so long as it works. My calls keep dropping after a few minutes (sometimes after 2 mins, sometimes after 10 minutes). Unfortunately I started using this a few days after delivery and am now stuck with a non-working product!Edit after 3 weeks of use: keeps getting disconnected even for music.Total WASTE

Rest is your call your money 😬

Fit - The fit is great for me. The design is slightly on the larger side. Mind you that for smaller ears it might be an issue, as this is an in-ear design and for the sound quality and passive noise cancellation to work the fit must be snug. It DOES NOT fall off while I am running or cycling.Build quality - The earphones themselves are built quite well. Light-weight yet feel sturdy. The case is a strong kind of plastic and is decent for the price. The lid magnets feel a little flimsy and could have been stronger but they wont open unless violently shaken.Bluetooth pairing - Works reasonably well as soon as you open the lid. Sometimes, one earphone (either left or right) might not pair to the phone. In this case just turn your phone's Bluetooth on and off and it will always work the second time around. I have never had a drop in Bluetooth connection unless I am standing more than 15 ft away from my phone and behind a lot of doors or obstacles.Sound Quality - The sound is decent. Bass is good but not too overpowering, although I would have slightly liked it a little more on the heavier side. Highs are super clean for me at this price range. The passive noise cancellation is good in a normal environment, I usually wear it on my morning runs and don't hear any ambient noise at all. It very crowded environments it might not work that wellCall quality - The audio quality is great. I can hear the other person well all the time and never faced an issue. On the flip-side, the person on the other end sometimes can experience low volume and disturbance from the ambient noise in my surroundings. During calls, the cancellation feature does not work too well. If you want a good call quality of no breaks and the other person hearing things well then you SHOULD NOT BUY this product.Battery - Battery back is as advertised and it charges quickly too. Always charge through your laptops USB socket and never a fast charge brick.Will update again after 8-9 months of usage!!

I bought this in the month on may and withing a month earphones on both sides stopped working. I sent a mail to them for repair/replacement under warranty. Did not here from them for more than a week.Then I called them up to inquire and they said it will take them 10-15 days to arrange a reverse pickup of the item due to the pandemic and then they will either repair it or send a replacement. This is in the month of May 2021 when the courier services started working normally.None of my follow up mails were.answerws by them and furstated, I filed a complaint against them in consumer court and sent them the complain number. You would not believe, I got a call from them straight away and they arranged for a reverse pickup the same day!I did not took my complain back though as I suspected they will take more time to send me a replacement. After 10 days or so when I did not hear from them anything I again droped a mail to them that I will be escalating the complain and ofcourse as expected they dispatched a replacement set the very next day and was delivered in 2 days.I mean they could have done this much before, without me having to file a complain against them, i.e. if they wanted to. I guess they don't intend to provide any kind of replacement to damaged pieces and just sit on customers complain until the customer is fedup and give up on it.However, the matter does not end here. The replacement set which they sent stopped working properly too within 15 days and again the exact same thing repeated all over again. I.e. they did not reply back to me, I raised a new complain and then they immediately arranged a reverse pickup and then sent a replacement piece. I am now scared to even start using them with the fear of having to experience this all over again.In the last 3 months, I have barely used the headphones for even a month but have spent more time waiting for replacement.Buy a boat product only if you want to have a similar experience as mine, otherwise please go for a good branded product.I wish someone had told me this too.

Writing this review after using it for 2 months. Really awful product. I've brought this on the initial launch. The touch sencors, connectivity and especially phone calls are very good as compared to any other TWS earbuds ranging from 2K-4K. I've used almost 10 TWS earbuds and nothing serves the purpose. Here are the list of Pros and ConsPros:1. At first, the call quality is way better than any other earbuds. I agree there will some disturbance to the other side on call however, the other person can clear understand what you are speaking. When it comes to other earbuds, the person can't even hear what you are telling (in comparison with all other 10 that I've used which includes boat, realme).2. Next comes the design, I've ordered this on the very first sale due to the attractive design and Boult delivered as promised.3. Then, the touch controls they are very prompt in response and it has the option of controlling volume also (many of TWS don't have) along with skipping tracks, responding to calls and Google/siri assistant4. Performance is also very nice, could not identify any drawbacks so far. (No comments on Gaming experience as I've not used for gaming)5. Connectivity also fine despite an issue occurred after 1 mon of use and get resolved, after cleaning the case and using6. Fit is amazing and sometimes I don't even realize the I'm wearing earbuds. Again it's depends on the ear design. For me it fits best7. Charging feels good like any other TWS. Not that extraordinary. On normal use can use for 3 days together with case on single charge. On continuous use, the buds last for 3-4 hrs depends on the volume the case give us minimum 4 charges to buds. And the charging time would be 1 hr for full charging of caseCons (I would rather say improvements needed):1. It would be much appreciated if the buds supports at least 2 devices at a time2. The case would have been a little stronger3. Battery capacity should have 2x to current, so that one can comfortably use for a week

Pros:  Once  paired with a device, subsequent pairing is very quick  Sound quality is good - but not great (music)  Range is very good. I could get connectivity  even at corners of the house.  Build is goodCons:  Call quality is very bad. It is so bad, that the other people were not able to hear me! I was forced to switch to a wireline hands free unit. If people want to use it for Calling - I strongly recommend not to buy it.  If anybody wants it only for listening to music - I think much cheaper options are available. Of course, I have not tried them.Summary: I regret buying the unit. Unfortunately, return is not possible.Edited:  I have requested for a replacement and it was promptly delivered. Same issue with the new piece! It even had 'touch control' issues. Touch was not working most of the time. I have tested the headset with' Voice Recorder' app  on my phone. Voice was hopeless! Now I understand why people were complaining about the voice quality in the call.  Thankfully, Amazon allowed me to return the headset

2 Hrs Review:Sound Quality: the vocals produced in these Propods are crystal clear and well produced. But their is very less bass because they are tuned to focus mainly on the vocals so to enhance vocals, bass is compressed. And in many songs you will feel there is no bass.Fit: They fit very snuggly in my ears.Battery: Not tested received two hours earlier.Build Quality: The case feels cheap quality plastic but the earbuds are well build.Mike: Kaam ChalaoFinal Verdict: after spending ₹2299 these does not satisfy your purchase as plastic build case and no bass. Better to go will Boat airdopes 441 or Realme buds air neo.

Product is decent but after using it around 2 monthsleft earpiece started creating trouble, draining very fastnot ever charging fully and after a couple weeks casestopped charging and the worst part is their customerservice.... after mailing them a lot they thankfullyreplied and arranged a pickup request and it took over amonth to get my airpods back and they didn't replacethey just repaired it and they gave only case andpropods without box which i send them while returning.Edited:The best part happens after submitting the review shown above, one of the executive called me and with his buttery words he asked me to delete the review and assured me that from now onwards better service will be provided and he also asked me to return the propods for the repair of the remaining faults but now he is not picking up the calls and i think i have lost my propods....Edited:Finally they replaced my product with a new product.""Better late than never""

When I first got them, they were great. Today, less than two months in, the left earbud randomly stooped working. The touch panel is working fine, but there's absolutely no sound out of the left earbud.Edit:After following up with the customer service center for a little over 6 weeks, they finally replaced the product. However, I sent them a black product, and they returned a white version. The packaging was for the black product, the accessories were black. Just the product is white. Moreover, I was told I would be reimbursed for the shipping charges for sending it in the second time, which never happened. By far the most incompetent customer service I've ever experienced. Amazon should immediately stop doing business with them.

*AFTER 10 DAYS OF USAGE*this is the worst purchase I've ever made so far in my life After just 10 days of usage the battery life is reduced like 50% it used to give like 5-6 hours on one full charge and including case it was like 20-22 hours now it's just half it just goes 100 to 0 in just 2 hours and sometimes only one earphone/powerbuds 'whatever the call it just connect and you have to manually reconnect it by disconnecting it and connecting so annoying and the product quality feels so cheap even at this price other brands are providing much better product and service""Don't buy this*Update like after 7 months*The product damaged via the charging port the charging port got stuck in the charger and after requesting for a replacement or repair they said they don't cover physical damage *lmao* and after all this someone called me after like 1 month and said they will give me a replacement if I delete or edit my review to a 5 star review then share share a screenshot and gave me some more instructions which I followed and guess what they're nothing more than scammers *stay away from this trash*

I thought of giving my review after a week extensive use of this product. I will be comparing it with my existing earbud SoundPeats Q32 which i got from US 3 years back and it still works, only battery life is short now thats why i wanted to buy a new TWS earbuds.PROS:- Crisp and Clear sound- Bass is there, but dont expect too much out of it.- Ergonomic design, fits well in the ear- Charges fast, could be due the the smaller MAH battery.- connects as soon as you open the flap- seamless connectivity to both earbuds in an instant.- Good mic for calling but u still need to be in less noisy area and have to speak louder than ur normal.CONS:1. Battery life is not as claimed and some users have already mentioned that it stops even though 20% battery is left. In my experience it goes all the way to 10% (red bar), but from 50% to 10% it lasts only 38 mins of use. Which i feel is very less. Also, total life is not more than 1 hour 50 mins, its discharging even when on standby. As, compared to the 3 years older earbuds i have which lasts 4 to 5 hrs on single use and 8 hrs on standy.2. Bluetooth connectivity is not that robust, the earphone keeps disconnecting and reconnecting randomly even while in use, or on standby, even if I am close to the phone, esp the right side master was giving this issue frequently.3. Touch is very sensitive, so you need to be careful when putting on and taking off or adjusting the earbud, hold the stem to do it.4. the Bluetooth range, is questionable for V5.0, i have a 3 years old TWS buds with BT 5.0 (which i got from US) they work well, and have a good range even while i am quite away from the phone and on another floor. But this earbud disconnects even lesser far. So it doesnt really seems a BT5.0 device.Comparing Boult touch vs Soundpeats non touch.- Mono mode is there but u cant sync two seperate phones on each bud with BOULT as i can do with my older TWS earbud.- if not in use for long time both shut off, unlike touch one, which u need to put it back in the charging box to turn on, I can turn the push button earbud without replugging to the base, which gives me convenience to not carry the case all the time.- Battery life on Boult is not long, so needs frequent charging, also the base charger needs charging every 3rd day, whereas my older one, i dont have to frequently charge it and base charger battery lasts more than a week for me (seems it has bigger battery than Boult)Conclusion:At the price point of 1800(on deal) bucks, i feel this is still a good choice, above average product but better than others in the same range - as in sound, build quality and reliability.But lack of longer battery life, uncertain bluetooth connectivity and short range, and missing ANC is some of the shortcomings which i feel, might be an issue for some, so they should go with a bud with higher value and has all these  features.

Sound quality is okay, it's good enough,Noise cancellation is like when your ear gets locked by the buds rubber cover,(Not really a NOICE CANCELLATION)Bass quality is too good only when u listen to a melody sony or chill song (yeah I mean it)If u r listening to the real bass song then u will feel the worst effect of this device.Not worth for money, causeBetter products are available in market for sure.(Main irritating thing is , if u r in a call , the other person is getting too much of disturbance, they are unable to get our voice clearly)And also this happened even when they replaced it. Other new one.

Now, I know Boult isn’t included in the major audio brands but these pair of TWS are really amazing. Trust me, I have tried AirPods 2nd Gen (not Pro) and these output better sound and a punchy bass. However these do not have active noise cancellation (no problem for such a price) but have a noise isolation fit so they block external sounds physically. Also, they have clear vocals, a punchy bass, secure fit, great volume, and charge extremely quickly thanks to the type-c connector. The only issue I found and this is a small one; the capacitive touch is too sensitive and boult should remove the single tap function because even when I want to simply adjust the earbuds, they register it as a tap and end an active call, and this is really frustrating. Other than this, the earbuds as I said are one of the best in the market.

After 10 days usage feedback share herewith.Sound quality average.Battery lasting average.But, connectivity and voice receiving, clarity in call worst. Other side of caller was not clearly audible our voice. That is biggest drawback of the product.Generally Customers main concern is that hassle free calling. But here this is not yet satisfied.At the same time good in videos, audios playing. You may purchase apart from calls usage.Touch quality not good. Once we try to command there is no response. Even call receding or end call.

Awesome Boult ProPods. The earbuds are very light when wearing & seems very very comfortable (more than Mivi Duopods M80). I like the sound quality & bass. However, noise cancellation is not upto the mark (which I can't expect to do wonders at this price). So noise cancellation is acceptable. Overall, as per my usage (music, YouTube & calls), I like the product (4/5). Will update review after using it for a week.
"
4062,"
The only reason I gave it 4 star is because of the frequent disconnection of phone calls. And it is not because of any inherent fault with the propods itself but because of frequent accidental touch registration by the device.The bass and audio quality is really great. Battery is also good. The case lid does not feel solid. The build quality is not premium, its okayish. Range is very good. Touch response is also good.Overall a value for money product. You can blindly go for it.

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 The product is received was well packed. But what really matters is the actual sound quality for music and more importantly call quality.Both which were terribly poor. Noise cancellation is a joke. I have used boult Bluetooth earphones earlier and that’s why chose to opt for these tws earphones. But unfortunately they are a real disappointment. I wonder how the reviews on YouTube and other platforms so very deceiving. Disappointed.

The Probuds are amazing for music. o ly the treble seems a little higher but everything else works fine. touch earphones for Alexa or Google assistant and touch to pause rewind next song etc. Alexa works great and hears you properly. Good bass as well. only for calls you may have to raise your voice for the other person to hear you but I got it for music so that's not an issue. I thought there was an issue earlier when the volume went very low suddenly I don't know how.. but all u have to do is press and hold the right earpiece touch area for a few secs and the volume comes right back up. love these buds.

Decent Bass with Premium finish. Value for money, best in the range, Great looks on earTouch works flawless.Advantage is both pods are master, hence you can use this as a monopod too. This feature is missing in almost all other pods.1 star is reduced coz, bass could have been much more better.This is my 2nd Boult product, i am impressed with the qualityGo for it guys

I got this mainly for taking calls and causal usage (excluding gaming). After roughly a week of usage, here are my thoughts on it.Pros:- Given the AirPods like design, It offers a good fit for prolonged wearing.- Lightweight.- Sound profile: Regarding the bass, as advertised, there is ""NO"" such magic but the bass is boosted ever so slightly than other frequencies. The unit I got, it has more like a v-shaped profile so the mids are slightly lesser but nothing concerning at all. All genres especially EDM will have the slightly thump and mids ever so slightly muffled while the highs are leveled off to the same as the bass. that's being said, this all heavily depends on the seal that you get with the cones that come with these buds. The default ear tips installed has a slightly wider opening, depending on the ear shape, it may not be sufficient for proper seal so one may take it as underperforming buds. I switched to the other tip that it came with which as a narrower hole but has a wider cone to get the perfect fit and that really made a very huge difference (milage will vary for everyone) that one will really appreciate. The trick to getting a good seal with these is to inset the ear tip first in the canal holding the lower half of the bud and twist it to the direction of the lobes to secure it perfectly.- Call quality: Tried this in silent as well as in a mildly noisy environment with ambient traffic around during travel, the other person did not have any issues hearing. It for some reason does not work well with hangout calls properly over the phone but works perfectly with normal and WhatsApp calls. The voice is too weak over hangout even if you scream at the mic on the buds.- Touch controls as opposed to button press.- no de-sync or lags with receptions nor signal drops. (Great for binge-watching)- Ample loudness, given the size of the drivers.- Good battery life so far. With the case fully charged and almost 9 hours of calls and causal music, the case still indicated two LEDs at the end of one full day.  (yet to test it properly)- Works in the mono mode (single bud) which is actually a boon for WFH scenarios.Cons:- These do not have the sensors on the bud to cut off the music when removed.- The touch is too sensitive at times.- There is a slight input lag with the response for touch.- The case has a very flimsy top feel and the pods themselves feel delicate to handle but they should be ok as long as its properly handled.

Does the job for listening to music...  audio quality is good, I have been using bose for quite sometime that's why will say good.... Noise cancellation for any outside sound  is pretty good. Super fast and easy connection process...battery life good....even touch response for changing songs and volume up/down is good.Challenges in connecting and using multiple devices at a point of time. Specially connections issues with my macbook I battled with it for a long time and finally gave up. Not so good for calls, does zero noise cancellation here. In general your voice goes low to the other person.Super light weight.. however not too comfortable over long usage.Overall good product for the price point

After using it for 2 months, these are my following observations.Pros:1. Connects very fast with mobile and laptop while maintaining same quality of sound.2. Doesnt fall off the ear.3. Surround noise is very well minimized4. Love the aesthetic.5. Very good quality sound for the price6. It accidentally fell in water.. And it survived! It is resilient too!Cons:1. Charging issue with left earbud. Left one constantly switches off, have to manually turn it on each time.2. Right earbud is discharging the entire battery of the case.3. Suddenly disconnects sometimes. And it is a nuisance while taking calls. Even a slight touch cuts the call.

I went against my gut feeling and purchased this and I am disappointed.I have not been able to use these pods as I can't take calls with them. The mic is useless. Have to plug one and put another one in hand near mouth to be audible to other party.The pods don't work more than 3 hrs on continuous zoom calls. The case seems a poor copy and doesn't give a study feeling.Ear stars paining after an hr or so of continuous usage.Although it does support type c and charges quickly but fails at the primary purpose.

Ergonomic Fit, Perfect packaging, Lovely crystal clear sound, Deep bass, Good trebles. The range of music is as comparable to my Air pods.Music latency is negligible and pairing is instant.Touch controls are not super sensitive, which for me is good, as you won’t accidentally disconnect calls or switch of music.The design of the TWS is good and gives a snug fit so a 5/5 on that.Overall for the price they are an absolute VFM. Have not yet checked the battery backup, but Boult is usually good

Sound quality is alright as long as you are talking. But the other party can't hear you properly, despite the 2 sticks sticking out. Bass is weak. Battery to doesn't last even 3 hours. No wonder they don't have a return policy on this one. It can only be replaced. So I'm replacing, butcustomer service has assured me that they'd see thatI can return the product of the replacement isn't any better. Let's hope for the best, though I'm sceptical; what if the 2nd paid is even worse.

Sound and connectivity is good. Battery 🔋 back up is good also. But there's a serious issue regarding touch inputs. A little touch to the pods disconnects the call.1. If yours pods are not in your ears when you get a call please don't try to pick it up. You will end up rejecting the call.2. If you are in a phone call and the conversation is a for duration, eventually you feel the buds are loosening from ears and if try to fit it by pressing it the the call disconnects because of super sensitive touch inputs.3. The mic quality is very bad. I have speak louder every time.4. I don't recommend this to anyone one.

Couldn't believe a 2k worthy pods would perform this much!! Unbelievably awesome! Initially the quality was not that good or I couldn't get the full bass..

Boult audio Propods is one of the worst quality earbuds available. It should be actually priced within 1000 rupees as I had very bad experience.1st thing- Absolutely 0% call quality. You need to scream louder for the opposite side to hear you. I replaced the product the next day itself thinking that the call quality was due to a product defect but the replacement one also came with the same issue.2. Cheap plastic has been used to built the product as well as case even though both looks good. The charging pins (golden colored) inside the case came out after few weeks usage and that alone shows the quality. I contacted customer care for a repair (I had black Propods) and they made their own pickup arrangements which was good. They sent it back after repair and to my surprise, I received a white Propods:D.  As I was tired of 3 replacements in total, i didn't go for a 4th one.3. Music quality and touch feedback is below average- No bass at all and touch control works for no reason sometimes even if you don't touch it (it responds automatically to any material if comes in contact with the touch area, even a pillow)Pros- Customer service is good, but not the product.I bought an OPPO w31 earbuds and i must say its outstanding in build quality as well as sound. Oneplus BudsZ is another best one. May be a 1000 rupees more than Boult but these are worth buying. Think and decide guys.

Overall feature, quality, music sound, call quality and look of product are awesome... But I have missing some things in this product, those are collected below...(Most important I have purchased it considering this as Made in india but it is MADE IN CHINA, but as per some google info the owner of company is INDIAN)1) You can not use FM by using this.2) You have to carry charging case every time if you disconnected from bluetooth to reconnect again.3) I don't know why but sometimes when I trying to connect with opening charging case, it will connect only one earbud....then it requires to restart bluetooth to connect both.

I like the product design ita nice and perfect. But the biggest drawback is sound and controll for which it's belongs to produce.Sound is toooooooooooo low. You have to go for  70 to 80 % for normal listening.Tuch and controll are too bad same as sound.It's not working. Basically it's moody if they want to work they work other wise it don't.I don't recommend  to waste this much of money for this type of product which don't full fill the basic things.

I bought the product about a month or so back. I am highly dissatisfied with the product as the charging case stopped working in a week's - 10 days time. I tried contacting the service centre, but that entire process is shady. Complete waste of money. Please do not but bout products their service is really bad, even in warranty you want get any sort of help.Bass as mentioned is not as greatClaim of 5 hours battery life is not genuineAnd the grip is bad, keeps falling outRating - 1

Pros:Build quality is good.Bluetooth connectivity is very good.Easy to use and chargeLight weightMusic is goodCons:Too much noise at the receivers end and background noise is more prominent.Big no for office calls and meeting.Can not use for regular calls because of no noise cancellation.Main objective of this purchase was to attend the long meetings and office calls during WFH but not suitable at all.

After listening to these pods, all other wired earphones including some JBL, Sennheiser, Sony, seemed quite lacking! Fantastic audio quality with very balanced and good amount of base! If at first you don't get proper base it's because of the fitting of the silicone buds, so change around the buds to see which one fits the best for you! Touch response is a little annoying while making calls as the upper part also sense touch and immediately ends the call when you try to adjust it but otherwise it's one good product for the price point under 2000.Go for it without any further wait!

UPDATED - The connectivity problem has suddenly disappeared and these pods now work great. The fit is also nice without causing any pain.These propods do justice to their price point. I feel it's a decent buy for around 2k. I've now used them for a month now and recently started facing problems with connectivity between propods. On several occasions only one pod gets connected, while the other doesn't. I have to put that in the case again to sort of manually maneuver the connectivity.Overall, the pods are actually good. Decent sound, bass and noise cancellation. Only the connectivity isn't as smooth as you'd want it to be.

Very inconsistent Product. Works one day, then goes off suddenly. The MIC is absolutely pathetic, does not works for most of the common applications like MS Teams, Skype , Google Meet. . Given attempts to get this replaced from Boult Audio, but still there is no response from them. Don't waste money on this.Customer care will just promise and no action will be taken by them. Absolutely unreliable company and services.Better to pay more and go for reliable products from Samsung and Boat.The customer support just keeps on calling and asking to revise the negative feedback on Amazon. Never go for any product from Boult Audio, pathetic quality , and after sales service.

Pros: 1) design2) touch Sensors works great3) battery life around 5 hours on single charge and case easily charges buds 4-5 times4) It shows when the buds are charging in the case that i really liked, you can easily test how much time it takes and get them out of the case for your listening5) Mic quality is good enough in the room but outside it picks up noises but yes it gets the job done6) sound quality is also pretty good but the bass is lacking not as they mentioned as extra bass if you are very much into bass then you will get disappointed for sure. Highs mids are all great , you can hear every instrument almost7) instant Pairing, range is also good 10mCons:1) Not for EXTREME bass lovers2) Touch sensors are very very responsive that you will get annoyed even if touch them to adjust in you ear3) blinking lights on the buds though they are not seen in the daylight but in the night they are bling bling when you are not listening to anything but if you are listening they turn offConclusion: you can definable consider them for the price and get them you will not be disappointed for sure!

Writing cons first as it is only one,Cons: not good fit in all ear types, you have to adjust frequently, can be minimised using right eartip for you, although it won't fall of, but you will feel like.Pros: Bass excellentConnectivity: Not a single time problem with hall sensor, its very easy after first time pairing.Loud clear vocal trebleBattery time very good as mentionedCall audio is very good, im traffic may be some disturbence to opposite side person.Very good in hand feel.Build quality perfect for this price.Light weight case as well as earbuds.

Please don't buy this propods if ur looking to use it for making calls and receiving calls. Call quality is pathethic and the person on the other end will not be able to hear what you speak. Either u need to speak very very loud for the other person to hear. Even though we got a replacement done thinking it could be a manufacturing defect but the second set of propods was the same result. So it seems the  brand itself needs to work upon the call quality.If u want a wireless earpod to listen to only music pls go for it as you would love the quality of bass and treble. I would say it's pleasant to listen to music but if ur a complete bass lover you will be disappointed. Noise cancellation depends on ur eardrums.For looks would rate it a 4.5 out of 5It feels very light and touch is very sensitive

 After a long search I have bought these TWS especially for design.But this product is very much average, coming to straight points*Cons*1) nosice cancellation doesn't work properly easily other person can here your surrounding noise.2) No extra deep bass but ok,threble is good.3) while making calls opposite person cannot hear your words clarity.4) Mainly after 3days of use Bluetooth is not connecting directly we have to manually connect.5) body is plastic made,even if case box fells hard it may damage.*Pros*1) Design is good.2) fits in ear good.3) charging capacity good.fast charging.4) Touch controls are also good.Finally overall rating 2.5 out of 5.Suggestion: heavy users best to avoid this product.

I really regret purchasing these and registering them for warranty. Unless you register within a few days, you will not get any warranty. But if you register, they will keep calling and messaging you every day from different numbers and force you to give a good review, then send the screenshot on whatsapp. Unless you do this, they will call atleast 10 times every single day. I wrote my earlier review with screenshots of the repeated calls, but it seems that Amazon does not allow this.

Bought these as replacement for Redmi Airdots.Build Quality: It had good build quality of both earpiece and case .The case has usb cSound Quality: the sound is kind of decent not that bad but the volume is a bit low for my liking.Fitting: the fitting in the ear is such that it won't push inside your earcanal that much but still stay snugly in ear due to its shape.Call quality is decent, one of the reason i choose this was because i wanted a decent microphone for the office calls.

1. No reliability of the product.2.Sound gets very distorted at 100% volume.3. Calling feature is so pathetic that If you sitting in a room where a celling fan is on You can't talk there, the mic are super sensitive or I don't what it is so much noise other person hear on the call.4. Overall battery is also not good as it claimed to be, I would not at all recommend the product for Rs.2500.5. The most important point Boult customer care calls the person who purchase their product and offer them Rs.100 as a google pay cash if they review their product positively and take screenshot of that and send it to them.It's a trap, Paid reviews nothing more, Please trust me, Else your wish your money.

Pros- Well balanced price.- Well balanced audio.Cons- only last for 1 month after it many problem is occuring to this TWS.(I) battery issue with it. It's only last for 10 min when you use.(2) one of the left TWS is not working.(3)it slips out of your ears easly when u walk or just exercise.- Customer care services is literally worst. They don't communicate to you easly. If you want to convey your problem than you have to fill form and wait for min for 3 days than they will replay.-if you want to replace or repair your product than you have to send your TWS to them via courier than they will repair it.- One more thing they don't repair it they only replace it with new one. (When I sent my TWS to them for repair they just replaced it with new one and the worst part in that was new one also  not working after few days.)- when you will sent your TWs for repair they will all most take 1 month to repair it and sent to you back. (Word most disaster service they provide to their customers)- My recommendation is plzz do not buy their product becz if one day your TWS will not work and you will go to them for service no one will care about it.

It is working properly with no issues till 3monthsA problem came now where right side pod is not working and i have contacted the boult service team they said they will take care of it by repairing it and i myself paid 200rs for courier service to send to delhi because they said they dont have pickup service for the products i said fine let it be and paid 200rs and sent product to them on may 25th 2021 and they said they resolved the problem and sent my pods back and when i got pods back it came up with 2 more problems from there side1. That pod which i said not working that bottom end is broken which is clearly visible2. By closing the lid of the pod box it should automatically disconnected and when we open automatically it should connect to our bluetooth Which is not happening nowAnd by this problem i have contacted them on the same day on april 12th and there by i got mail from boult stating we will reslove it again and no reply from the company till april 19th then again i kept review of the product in amazon then immediately after posting in 4hours i got call from boult service stating that we will reslove your problem we will arrange courier service and we will rectifine the problem by telling this they said remove the review which i have given in amazon and said to give good review, even that also i did and i haven't got any mail from the boult service but still am getting calls from boult stating remove the review of mineSeriously felt so disgusting instead of resloving my prb they are stating to remove review and its been 2months that i gave compliant till date no response from them

Product is worth buying and lives to its expectations. Very easy to operate and connect to multiple devices. I invested a good amount of time reading all the reviews from different buyers and was biased with the experiences. However, with the past experience of using Boult Curve, I decided to buy the Airpods and I must say, the product  has lived up to its expectations.Amazing voice clarity, range coverage and easy connectivity to multiple devices. I have randomly tried connecting it to multiple mobiles, Laptops and each times it was just a few seconds of connectivity. The sound quality is amazing and will surely keep you engrossed in what you hear.Buds are very light weight and you dont even feel sometimes they are on the ears. ( Just that the touch sensor is very sensitive and accidently touching it will disconnect the call or music ) otherwise, this product has all the quality and features that a TWS promises.Worth the price and quality. Lastly, I have been a great fan of Amazon for the past 5 years now and all the products that I have purchased from Amazon are truly genuine and have lived this life expectancy very well .

I start with -- its very pathetic to have Boult airpods. Earlier I had made a review about the product that it is very poor in sound and stops connecting intermittently and sound goes on decreasing and increasing without any command. After that I send the product twice to boult customer care and again faulty product has been delivered again and again.2nd time boult customer care has requested me to delete the bad review and they accepted that product is faulty and they planning to send me the exchange for the same. But its ridiculous , even boult customer care spelled lie and inspite of sending me new airpods in place of faulty one they had send me the refurbished product and even the product is not Boult Audio AirBass Propods TWS Earbuds, it is of different quality and it is the refurbished and again faulty one.Guys I planning for the consumer forum complain to boult for this product. Guys please look for better product before buying for such pathetic product.

Have used for over 6 months now, seems to face problem while calling, person on other side of the call not able to get clear voice. The case build quality is little fragile. Connectivty and paring are good and fast. Battery is good. Fit is comfortable and touch is very sensitive. Sound quality is average. Bass is neglible. The product needs much improvement. Would not suggest this model.

WARING DON'T GET THE CASE WET BECAUSE IT IS NOT WATERPROOF IF YOU DO THEN THE ELECTRONICS INSIDE WILL GET CORRODED AND IT WILL STOP WORKINGI'm very happy overall but I have a few small issues.Complains1. The noise cancellation is very bad.2. The initial driver install with windows takes some time and till it does the bluetooth is very flakey.2. They are not tuned very well for windows or there is a bug in the driver where it starts automatically playing in mono mode and when you switch it to stereo mode you can't hear anything.

QUALITY AND REPLACEMENT ISSUECharging port stops working after few weeks and they took almost one  month to replace with an USED product. Yes. they sent me an used product as replacement and it was not the color I originally sent.CHARGING ISSUEAnyway, after a few days I use it and left earbud stops charging unless I remove and insert it multiple times. I cant just close the case and assume it’s charging. I have to make sure they’re actually charging or I’ll end up with a dead earbud.PAIRING ISSUESOne in 5 times, only one earbud pairs and I have to repair with the device all over again. Sometimes it keeps repeating ‘pairing’ and doesn’t do anything.I wouldn’t write this if these issues occur rarely. But these happen every single day and I’m FRUSTRATED! Its a low quality product. Its like that saying, “If you give peanuts, you will get monkeys “. Shell out a little more and buy a reliable set of earbuds.

I had to get it replaced for the first time (Excellent support from Amazon) since I was under an impression that the product delivered to me was defective. After getting the replacement/fresh unit discovered it's all the same and simply an extremely over-rated product. Honestly speaking, this actually sounds like a cheap product whose price should not be more than 500 INR. Very very dissapointed. It is a fact that the sound is crystal clear, but there is no bass effect at all, forget about extra bass which this company claims for this product. I have been maintaining a patrongae for Amazon since the year 2013 and this is indeed the best e-commerce platform in India right now, so earnest request to Amazon not to advocate such under-performing products in their esteemed website so that their impeccable reputation is not at stake.

Beware of Boult lightning deals!! Volume fluctuates randomly without any user intervention on all my gadgets Android, Mac and Windows. Also launches Siri and Google Assistant randomly. I had ordered two pairs of Boult Propods in a lightning deal, both had the exact same problem. Got replacement for the first one as that was within the Amazon replacement window. Replacement Propods are working fine so far. Other one started malfunction after day 7 so couldn't get a replacement from Amazon. Have raised the complaint with the Boult customer service (as they provide a 1 year warranty) more than a week back but haven't heard  anything from them yet. I don't think their customer service cares once they have sold the defective product.

1)Connectivity is superb,2)touch sensor is awesome3) sound quality is above my expectations for this price range. Clear vocal, trable and good amount of bass4) call quality (that's why I needed this earpod) very good , I personally checked being on other side of the phone , clear and accurate . Though there is no perfect noise cancellation things but as for as it's clear and audible I am ok with it5) battery is fine 4 hours on earpod and you can charge 2.5 to 3 times inside a case. So overall 15hrs approx6) comfortable n light weight but yes if you are hardcore runner, cyclist, jumping pumping excerciser than I don't recommend .My overall rating 4/5 (very good at this price range)

 I just ordered these buds after one day use a can say at this price point you can get better than these pairs of buds. Want to share with you some spec..1. Betery life is good.2. Built quality above average..(4.5/5)3. Connectivity excellent..(4.6/5)4. Buds comfort it's light wait but not so comfortable. (4.0)4. Audio quality. I expected more but it's not that much good you need to keep full volume to barter and clear sound, comes with very less of bass trable is good not for those who want a good amount of bass but in normal use its good..(4.4/5)6. Phon calling- you can do better calling for 3 hours  and also mic voice is good I didn't notice any lac in calling l..(4.5/5)7. Gaming yes you can do gaming with this it has latency but its miner if you are pro gamer or heavy gamer than it's not recommended for you.(4.1)

Otherwise I will keep it with me.Thanks to Amazon, boult and seller.Boult if you increase the battery capacity it would be great.

first of all i got this product within 2 days so thanks to amazon. build quality of product is good, it will take upto 2 hours to full charge the case(thanks to type c). Best part of this product is battery which is around 5 hours of airpods and 20 hours with case. Now comes the sound quality, it has a good sound quality voices are clear but bass is not that good means average, i dont think it has good noise cancellation. blutooth connectivity is good range is very good. call quality is good at home, in traffic i cant tell. it has light indicator so you can tell if airpods are charging or notConclusion: best under 2500 (although i got it for rs2349). go for it as it also comes with 1 yr warranty and has long battery life and light indicator

This is an amazing product, given its cost. PROS:-1) Very crisp and clear audios, although the bass lacks a bit of punchBut still amazing for most songs2) Great Battery BackupWithout charging case they last roughly 4-4.5 hours, and with the case they last around 20 hours3) Comfortable and secure fit (provided you have the right sized silicone eartips). It does feel at times that the earbuds may fall out, but a slight push would secure them4) Low latency- useful for gaming as well5) Good touch controlsResponsive, but too sensitiveCONS:-1) The lid of the charging case does feel a bit flimsy and fragile. So please dont ever drop it2) The audio lacks a bit of depthIts only an issue if you're using them for gaming. For music, the sound quality is amazing3) Not so great bass (as mentioned before), but can be enhanced using an equilizer, and so not much of a problem4) Extremely sensitive touch controlsYou might be adjusting the earbuds, but end up activating the voice assistantSo be careful not to touch the receptor area whenever adjust the earbuds5) Not so great Env Noise Isolation.Its passive camcellation only, so that was expected and depends on the fit of the eartips. But it's still somewhat less in my opinion than could have been possible. Perhaps using some other eartips would provide better noise dampening.6) The volume is a bit lowBut its not really problematic, as I can listen well enough at 60-70% volume

REVIEWING AFTER ONE WEEK USE:First things first....you will get good features in this TWH and build quality is also very good....but.....1. Some may feel fitting issues...even after using diff. Size ear tips.2. Noise cancellation is very poor....other person can't hear you on call even if there is minor background noise.3. Easily gets paired but you may feel connectivity issue some times, specially when phone is inside your pocket.4. You may be bit disappointed for bass but sound quality is very good and crystal clear.5. Placing of touch controls is very pissing..Every time i try to adjust ear buds while calling, it gets cut.6. You may feel negligible latency while playing online games like pubG and COD.

Overall a good product. Amazing bass. In phone calls, microphone won't work as good though. Might cause problems if your phone's Bluetooth is lower than this product's; but if it's the same or higher there're no issues. Don't panic if any problem occurs, just contact boult audio and you'll get proper assistance. I faced problem with the left earbud within 3 months but got it replaced after contacting boult.

No bass. Vocals ok. Comfort ok. Batter backup ok.Lekin awaaj sun k zyaad mazaa nhi aaya. Price k according sahi nhin hai.

Wo maine 530 rupees me local market se liya tha.Aur ear me is Boult earpod ka look side se to sahi lgtaa hai.

It really looks premium and sound and battery back seems to be good.but when i was on call other end person seems to have a complaint regarding the sound on the other end..i tried with couple of calls to to write this,one more thing which is very annoying is that touch on ear buds are too sensitive calls gets disconnected 1 or 2 times,if you accidentally touch the ear bud it will end the call.

I have bought black color Boult audio AirBass Propods for a very reasonable price in Amazon festive sale. These are very handy, sleek and can be carried to any places easily. I have been using them past three months for my online classes ,watching YouTube videos, movies , series and listening songs. They are very comfortable and does not cause any sort of irritation while using them.  Even after listening continuously for 4 hours of online classes, the charging still lasts. It takes a few minutes to completely charge . They give a better sound quality and clarity. If you want to get a good quality ear pods for a reasonable price then these are highly recommended. These are best value for the money.

I am writing this on real scenario that I purchased the product on 16th July,2021. It worked fine (not great ) in terms of sound quality, mic quality is way too poor. After a month , the right bud wasn’t charging. I tried multiple times to connect to them but their vague and amusing replies got my nerves. I suggest you not to buy these and if you want to buy an earpode for a month then only go for it. I request and urge you that if you dont wanna spoil your single penny then avoid this worthless product.

The only good thing about these is the battery backup. On 100% volume it lasts around 7-8 hours. Apart from that, the quality and durability of the product is definitely questionable. Had to get it replaced thrice and the last ones i received have been working so far so good for past 2 months. Go for boat or some other brand if you can.

Bought this pair of propods 1.5 months back and here is my short feedback. The sound quality for listening to music and movies Is decent but call quality is very poor. I have not been able to have even a single call till now without the person on the other side saying that they were not able to hear me. So don't buy it if you are planning to use it for calls.

Overall this is good buy for the price range, however the sound is not so great. It has very less volume when connected to iOS device but little better with Android devices.Noise cancelling is just on the box, litterraly it doesn't have any noise-cancelling feature. In fact it observes the outside noice more than the user's voice and reproduces it to the other end.Good for using only at home, definitely not good for the louder surroundings.

Decent hardware. Poor software optimization.ISSUES: It is very easy to trigger Google assistant even though it is supposed to be triggered only by a long press of the touch interface. So every time I touch the unit to adjust it, boom! Google assisstant is triggered. Other touch panel controls rarely seemed to work for me although I never really expected them to work well at this price point.SOUND: The sound is above average but for sibilant highs. Good amount of bass if you get the position right.BATTERY LIFE: Fantastic as of week 2.FIT: I swapped the stock eartips immediately because those were too small for my ears. It does stay securely in the ears nonetheless.So would I recommend it? If you're willing to live with these compromises and don't have high expectations then sure, go ahead.

Considering I bought these pair of buds for 1800/-, the sound and mic quality are pretty good.The battery life is also impressiveMy biggest and only complaint is the build of the buds. Its not as comfortable as i would like them... My crossbeats torq are much more comfy and secure.Im always apprehensive when wearing the boult propods.The narrow stem makes it difficult to use for the touch controls

I've been using this product for almost a month now and I have to say it, these tws earbuds are amazing and have exceeded my expectation! Here are my short & honest review/pros & cons list about the features of Boult Audio AirBass Propods that I liked & disliked.Pros:- Amazing sound.- Good built quality for both earbuds & the charging case.- Lightweight. I've been using it day in & out where it be for running, working out or to attend meetings.- Excellent battery. Earpods battery last around 4-4.5 hrs or even up to 5 on a single charge (Depending on usage) & with the case it offers 4-5 times complete charge cycles, which last up to an entire day depending on your use.- Good microphone. The built-in mic is quite good for answering and receiving calls, just don't expect too much noise cancellation, it gets the job done.- Good for casual gaming. I've tested these earphones on PC games like CSGO, GTA online, Fortnite and even Minecraft (lmao), you can expect a minute delay which is not that recognisable.- Good Bass. I'm not that into bass but I really enjoy the sound quality & the sound output of these earbuds. I don't know why there's so much hype around EXTRA BASS in the earphones If all you want is bass then buy JBL subwoofer.- Good touch sensors. It's a really handy feature and sensors are pretty good.- Faster Connectivity. These earbuds connect/pairs to your device within seconds. Just open the case and you're connected. Note: It connects automatically to your last device so if your earbuds are paired with 2 or more devices, the last device which was connected it will automatically get paired if the Bluetooth is on. this doesn't apply to some users who are only pairing it with a single device.Cons:- Touch sensors are too sensitive for the calls. You can accidentally disconnect an ongoing call just by a touch.- No passive voice cancellation. They mentioned passive voice cancellation but I never experienced it. But not a problem.- Earbuds are super lightweight which can easily fall off if your ears are sweaty if you are working out in the gym.- That's It. No further cons.lastly, It's an amazing product for that price, I bought these at 2k during the sale. I would totally recommend these to anyone whos looking for good tws earbuds under 2k.

At this price point I must admit that u will not get a better earphone with such features. Bass quality is good though initially I thought it's not good but u have to increase the volume by touching the right ear pod and holding it for more than 5-10 seconds. Clarity and sound quality is 4/5 absolutely perfect considering the price point. Another important thing is it hurts in the ear due to its design and depends on person to person. Noise cancellation is not that good but u can't complain. Another thing is this product is made in china though Boult is trying very hard in Indian market and to be honest they are doing a good job but if the products are made in india then it will be good. Overall better than its competitors like boat. I am using it for the past one month and my experience is not good because it stopped working all of a sudden. At first the right one stopped working and it was taking a bit more of charge and now all of a sudden both stopped working. Greeting message is there while starting but after that nothing I applied for replacement on Boult customer service page I donno wat will happen next but I think my 2.5k is lost.

I wont write the reviews unless the product is useless. I normally use the wired Headset and this time i thought ill use the wireless one and i am disappointed with the first product itself.I recieved the product on 29th of Nov and started using it as soon as i recieved and made few calls, i am able to hear them but the other person can hear very low. So i returned the product thinking some problem in Mic, i got the replacement on 1st of dec again i am facing the same issue. Mic is pathetic and of low quality very less they can hear.If you think you need to take lot of calls then dont go for this boult Propods the Mic is pathetic, the other caller barely would be able to listen to you. You need to shout if the other person needs to listen to you.since i get lot of calls this product is useless for me. Because of Mic poor quality i am writing this review.

Good earphones. Right amount of features and performance. Overall build quality could be better and consistent on both the earpods and also the case. Mic is good but could be better compared to some other products that cost less. If youre in a noise free room, then its fine. Overall, must buy and I feel the price could be around ₹1499. But given the design its a good buy at ₹1999 as well. Buy soon while the design is still fresh, relatively!

This is a total useless product not worth of even 1000 rupees initially it was good in writing this review after 10 days of usage a very minimal usage you can sayPros:1. Design and it feel very light even the fit is also good unless if you try to sleep on on side2. Decent audio especially with mids are goodCons:1. Super senstive touch it can operate if it get touch with pillow when u sleep on onside2. Poor mic poor noise cancellation atleast I’m not expecting noise cancellation atleast a decent mic should have been there3. Lag in the callsBuild quality is good but I’m not a pro user of pods my true intention to buy this is to take calls that’s all when it connects to teams it’s has a lag of almost 5-7 seconds that’s also bad in callsEven with Regular calls also we can able to talk properly need to speak very high then there is no point to use theseComing to customer care they can’t ans the calls they can’t take proper feedback.If you are aiming for calls don’t buy this waste of money I’m not comparing with others but your purpose won’t surviveAfter 10 days of usage the mic issues are increasing I missed my return date in Amazon otherwise I would have returned this don’t know how many issues it raises in coming days.

The usp of these propods is it's charging, range, waterproof nature and Bluetooth connectivity which is automatic on removing from the case once Bluetooth of the mobile is switched on. Sound is good but noise cancellation not so much. The ergonomics are good but not so much for small ears. The worst is the support centre who do not repond more than once to warrranty and if u miss their call after registering they will not call back. But it is a steal for 1999.

It is ok if you want to buy for just listening to music or watching a movie but don't bother to buy if you want to take calls. Never properly worked for me for calls. The person on the other side of the call always hear disturbance and you have to should to make your voice reach there.Battery is ok. Lasts about 4 hours on full charge of the buds if you are watching a movie. It starts giving you notification with 40% battery left. And when it dies, most of the time battery of one of the buds dies first. Second one lasts another 10 mins before it dies too.Grip in the ear is good. Doesn't fall easily.

Performance was below average on these headphones. The volume is so low, my 2 year old, cheaper Ptron buds performed better. Noise cancellation is poor. Worst of all, the touch controls are poorly planned and most of the times you would end up pausing/changing tracks unintentionally. Better to go for something else.

I got this product about a week ago and overall happy with the performance.  My main purpose was for bluetooth calling which for most part worked well. I didn't hear many of the callers complain about not being able to hear me.The couple of pain point1) the control on the ear buds are extremely sensitive and hence while adjusting the buds , if you are on call you may get disconnected.  Also the Google assistant gets activated everytime you put the device on.2) While the label says 24 hrs playtime, I am not 100% if that's true.  Also I think the call time is also about 3 hrs but if you have the case handy  you can put in their for it to charge and there by extending the battery life of the buds.Finally, as of this morning the right ear buds stopped working and hence will be returning this but not sure if this is a one off but keen to try one more time.Update : I did order the second pair and it was delivered within 48 hrs. Its working absolutely fine. The only pain point is the ultra sensitive touch so when you are on a call and try to adjust it, you will end up getting disconnected.

 Firstly in the video you can see we received an defective product. It was really nice to Amazon without any trouble they replaced my product for exact same price which I brought. Later you can see pictures yes it did worked this time but honestly me and my brother didn't liked the bass, we can definitely get some better. Ofcourse the vocals was clear. Also earbuds was not loud enough I am pretty sure if I am traveling won't have compete experience of the music. So we placed for return and this time too Amazon was helpful enough to provide me return without any trouble.

Although this being my first bluetooth tru wireless earpods I'd really like the brand itself from my previous wired earphones that I bought.Sound quality is always great from the brand for the price bracket when I say great really awesome that I bought 3 more for friendsNoise cancellation is good as well as been using regularly for regular calls.Connectivity is pretty good where I just roam around my 2bhk house keeping my mobile device at a single location without any lag or latency issuesAdditionally I would like to appreciate the design itself for the comfortable fit because usually my older earphones were uncomfortable over longer period of time to this doesn't happen with boult pods.Only con I've observed that battery life is drained quickly when used with different devices.

I purchased zebronics pair recently for Rs.950/-. Except noise cancellation product is ear feast for music lovers. Now I bought this pair for both music and quality calling. But I felt I have cheated by this product. No bass, no noise cancellation. Even in a silent environment I cannot hear  caller voice properly. My voice also not audible another person who called me. I'm regretting bought this product. I think Amazon also know product quality that's why don't provide refund policy. Another bad experience with AMAZON.
"

Absolutely not worth the price. While the audio quality is decent for a 1k INR product, the mic is absolutely horrible. You cannot use it for calls at all. The touch controls are a gimmick, and NEVER worked properly for me. There were so many unintended touch activations as well, I could barely use it while lying down. To top it all off, one of the ears stopped working a mere month after the purchase. Save your money and spend it on something else.

First of all, I don't know to do a proper reviw...Here Im sharing my experience..After doing a lot of research I found this tws... There was a tonne of reviews on Internet. But the main problem I found was there was 2 type of reviews in the Youtube community... Some say this has a very powerful bass...and the other claims there is not at all any bass.... Now that I got the product I can help you.So the bass is powerful... You can hear every drops... But the problem is that Your ears cannot feel the bass.. That vibration like feeling...That is absent here... I am a bass lover... and from my perspective that lower frequency vibration is not necessary....Sound quality is the best part..🔥.Build quality is solid.. hope it would last a bit...Touch controls are good...It would take a little to get used to find spot on pods exactly where to touch....So my Verdict.. You can go for the product if you want a clear and clean sound...unless you want the powerful bass notes which makes your ear feel the notes😊

Edited - So today these guys called me after a month if my query has been resolved, and they did nt even know that i have received my replacement. Anyways this guy who called today asked me to delete my review.I mean why - Even though the product is fine , but their customer service is worst. No updates for months and  all those long call holds. Seriously guys , now you want me to delete the review.Own up to it and accept your mistake instead of telling people of delete bad reviews.They asked me to return the product for them to check that it's not working. They received the product and after that I am just following up with them for an update but no response from them .

Just a headphones at this price point.Final update: Repaired headphones have been sent back to us and now works fine. Would prefer if customer service is more prompt. Thank youUpdate: Cannot hear anything now. So would recommend to buy something else. I am going to……Update: company contacted and shall be arranging pick up after lockdown to get it sorted.Update: sudden drop in earphone volume in one ear. Customer service was contacted and was sent 5 emails, 1 email told they will arrange courier and rest asked me to arrange courier. Then replied and no response.Would definite think twice.

Pros: The overall audio quality is good for listening to music. Overall bass is good and other notes as well. Battery lasts upto 2.5+ hours on earbuds when used for music+calls - maybe for music alone it might be more, best thing is that you can use one earbud while other charges, then swap - thus you can use it for quite a long time. Case charges comparatively fast. Convient to carry. Fits well in my ears.Cons: not the best for calling. Sometimes it's good but many times call quality suffers for the person on other side - also it picks up and is sensitive to surrounding noise . Earbuds switch off sometimes just like that even when charge is there and phone is nearby.  When earbud battery is 30% it switches off - so not sure what's the use of remaining 30%. If Boult somehow corrects this via update or something then battery life will be even greater.Overall I would say it's good, but don't expect too much if using for calls.

The earbuds definitely look amazing. They seem pretty well built and are definitely gonna add to your style. The sound quality is pretty good. It's not very bass-heavy, but I don't personally prefer a lot of bass, so this works pretty well for me. I haven't had any problems with calling either. The audio is clear. The microphone picks up sound beautifully. The auto pair feature works flawlessly. There are a few times there was trouble with connecting to my laptop (they connected, but nothing was audible; but they worked other times), but with the phone, they work pretty well and without a problem. They're more or less comfortable. They might feel uncomfortable for people with smaller ears. But they're a snug fit, so I won't have to worry about them falling off. Also, the battery life is pretty great. I charged the Propods and the case till it was fully charged. One battery cycle for the earbuds alone lasted for about 6 hours or so. It wasn't continuously used for music, but there were video calls etc involved and they lasted for a fair bit, and I still had the case to charge the pods again. The charging process itself doesn't take too long either.P.S. There was a problem with the delivery but that had to do with Amazon and the delivery centre. Can't blame Boult for that.

Pros:1 battery life:10\10 it is what they say in the specifications2 build quality: 8\10 it is prety good, not the best. But it does not feel cheep3 Sound quality: 10\10 there is no distortion in the sound it is crisp and clear.Cons:1 connection: sometimes a single bud does not switch on but it is just a 2 second step given in the manual to switch the bud on.2 call quality: you literally have to scream for the other person to hear you. The mic quality is very bad.Overall it is prety good if you don't want to use it for calling. There is a small lag in gaming which is not a big problem for casual gamers. And it is very good for listening to songs

6 months reviewBought this TWS on 20th Jan. The sound quality is pretty good for this price range. You can easily differentiate the highs, lows and the mids. The noice cancellation, I would say is ok-ok. This does not have ANC so you basically just get Passive Noise cancellation, but it's good. The receiver on the other end would understand you quite nicely. As with every other TWS, this is actually not that good for Gaming due to latency issues. The bass in this TWS is good for this price range. The bass will never overpower the rest, it just has a right bang to it.After 6 months, just last month ie July, the volume in the right Earbud deteriorated. Contacted the Boult Service Center, and they replied within a day or two. The problem got resolved and the Earbuds are working as quite new.If you have a tight budget of 2500/- then I would definitely recommend you to buy these ones.

1 day review: Bought on 20/1/21I used AKG earphones that came with my galaxy note 9 before these. So, the comparison is based on their standard.Case: the upper flap is of medium quality, fuctions great now, but feels like it will break in 2-3 months maybe( I hope they don't though)Sound quality is decentNoise cancellation works well if volume is max, when volume is set to medium then noise cancellation is not that great as compared to AKG.Bass is great, they did a good job here.The silicon tips that go in the ear are slightly low quality, I swapped them with the AKG ones.Fit: they are not that great when talking about fit because I have to adjust them after every 15-20 mins and every time I adjust them I accidentally touch the button and it registers it. Yesterday, I disconnected the call 3 times accidentally while adjusting them.WALKING WHILE WEARING: Not a great Idea.SUGGESTION  TO BOULT AUDIO: You are doing a great job and you're products are amazing. Just make the fit your priority for future products and you'll be the best in the market.

I bought this considering the reviews and it was not cheap in its category but i was disappointed from its audio quality and constantly observed in my 3 weeks of using it. Some of the issues faced are1- The call quality is poor and call disconnects automatically.2-The both the pods sync differently and call sound lags in left piece3- while watching videos on youtube the sound is not loud and also not constantly pitched. The sound dims and louds autmatically and humms in between...4- While driving in car the ear pods donot deliver the clear sound and automatically disconnets.5- The touch buttons also donot function well with all apps.I donot recommend buying this to anyone as this is the worst wireless pods.
"
4156,"
This is my first time using ear pod,so i am satisfied.Sound quality is great, base decent though noise cancellation is acceptable.Gives 2 to 3 hrs in single continuous use than need to be charged in charging box provided.Still need to ascertain exact output( pods n box) but i expect 10-11 hrs output.Sometimes feels as if pods are still connected to phone when inside the case, that shouldn't happen.Rest its a good decent product in its price range.
"
4157,"
Weird humming noise in the left bud, also the touch never works when u have to pause the audio but its super sensitive when ur trying to fix the buds in ur ear and it would cause the track to skip or something like that.It also keeps pausing and sometimes loses signals while turning head. Its so infuriating.
"
4158,"
First thingThe sound - The Extra bass mentioned in the name is not there in the actual earphones. Highs are clear but the mids sound a bit tinny.Control and features :The touch panel responds to all kinds of objects, not just human touch, be it a pillow or some piece of cloth. Case in point - you can't wear it under your helmet, which was why I bought these.Call Quality-Pretty much useless for making calls. Forget outdoors, can't have a proper conversation even indoors. I had to shout so the other person can hear me but that didn't work either.Pairing and connectivity-The only area where I don't have any complaints. Connectivity is on point, pairing is quick. Switching from monopods to TWS and vice-versa is super smooth.
"
4159,"
Giving a five star purely coz of convenience to use and value for money. At this price point, it's really decent. Earpiece has to be frequently adjusted. And sometimes while adjusting the call gets disconnected. The mic is sad, have to repeat for the opposite person to hear.Sound is ok. It's decent. Noise cancellation when using both pods is also decent. Not too great or impressive but worth the money. Used it for a few months. Battery also works fine..

 HOPE YOU FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL..! Product is fine.. But BOULT AUDIO CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE ""WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN INDIA.."" Please don't buy1) MY LEFT EARBUD STOPPED WORKING, IN JUST 2 MONTHS, I DELIVERED IT TO SERVICE CENTRE IN JUST 3 DAYS, THEY TOOK THREE DAYS TO REPAIR AND NOW THER ARE DELIVERING IT THROUGH A CHEAP COURIER SERVICE WHICH IS TAKING TEN DAYS, THEY DON'T ANSWER OUR CALL, WHICH IS WAY WORSE, BOAT HAS BETTER SERVICE CARE.WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER BOULT PRODUCT.Got my product delivered today.. Ordered it 3 days ago thanks to Amazon...Regarding to the product it's awesome..earbuds pair as soon as you take them out and touch response is good1) The case which is very good with matte finish..propods are also fine..So the build quality is overall good2) Sound : Bass is very decent I can't say it's very high.. Above average.Loudness is balanced, sound is crystal clear even at full volume with perfect mids and lows.. Balanced acoustics..3) Mic/Call Quality : call quality is also good, no lags are found.lots of negative reviews are there regarding this, but don't trust them,person on other end of the call can hear your voice clearly.4) noise cancellation : Company claims it has Passive noise cancellation, but it isn't up to the mark, but noise reduced to certain level for sure.5)Gaming Latency : even it's said it has low latency,I experienced a lag of 0.2-0.8 sec while playing pubg  (not recommended for serious gamers). But it's decent.6) Battery : Average 4 hours around, as per your usage and battery backup is decent with 22 hrs along with the case.7) controls : touch is responsive.. Lots of options to play/pause and also for voice assistant and calls.. Please take note that we don't have control option to adjust volume (increase/decrease) in propods.. We have to rely on phone8) best is it's monopod feature both are master earbuds9) no APTX support10) pricing : it's pretty good value for money at this price range.. I got it below 2k..perfect competitor for other boat products and any other Tws for upto 2k price

Nice pair of TWS, nice finish too, audio wise reproduction is clear but bass is low and call conversation is fair enough in quite environment but otherwise. Now the pathetic part, seller screwed up the product description, as stating as micro usb but it's type c charging port. Now, I have to change the cable every time I need to change and that's what I really wanted to avoid. Insincerity in inscripted seller.

After ordering Boult, First 4 month it was working good, I had no problem with it but after 4 month of usage the sound quality started decreasing and few days later there was no audio, I complained and got it repaired from Boult but again after 1 week of usage the same problem started occurring, this time not only audio was off but problem in charging battery and also even dispite of not being connected with Bluetooth it says your Boult is connected with this device etc etc.

Build quality- you’ll know straight away when you remove it from the case...no where close to any kind of a premium feel...doesn’t even feel like it’s worth ₹2499! Put in features but compromised on build quality.Audio - Sad bass! Audio is just clear that’s all...nothing great at all.Connectivity - super fast. No problems there...at least for the few times that I checked before returning this product!Touch - unnecessarily over-sensitive. Very inconvenient.Yes, they are offering a true-wireless at this price. Probably was a mistake to go for this at such a price point. Anyway, please DO NOT go for this. Prefer any other kind of wireless. Do not cheap out just to get a True wireless buds!

I am putting this revieew after using it for 6months. Initially the product was good but all of the sudden it atarted gibing issues with its touch. First time i started facing issue after one month of purchase that the left earbud automatically lowers the volume without touching the earbud. I got a replacement but again i started faving the same iasue within 2months in the replaced product.Then after few months i sent it again to their service center for the same issue. They sent the same product may be after repairing it but it is not working as it used to work. The whole process got slow. Now its taking huge time to slow down the volume than it used to.Overall a bad product is very very bad and their service is more worse than the product. I do not know how much time it would work fine for this time.

Honestly speaking, this is my first pair of wireless earphones (or earpods) and to get something as cool looking at this is totally worth the wait and money. I have never been too comfortable shifting to wireless earphones for the fear of losing them. I enjoyed unboxing the earpods and showing them off to my near and dear ones (got a few jealous eyes on my earpods).I can say that the sound quality and comfort is really good cause I have used earpods owned by my friends and I never thought I could catch up to this trend cause they felt uncomfortable in my ear. I'm still getting used to the touch-sensitiven controls, but I'm loving the fact that it connects automatically and hasn't once been disconnected because of bad network. I have sometimes gone out of range, but the moment I come back within range the earpods just pop back to life.PS: I have a few envious people who have spent more on their earpods and haven't really fallen in love with them (too bad for them). I got this beauty for a handsome price tag of 1999 INR (Perks of being a Prime user, isn't it!).

I am using this probuds for last 15 days and here is my view about this.1 - Sound Quality :- sound quality is good, especially bass is amazing.2 - Noise cancellation :- There is no active noise cancellation but soft ear buds can cancel most of noise.3 - Call Quality - This segment is very poor in this buds. Sometimes The person on the other end could not hear your voice clear and background noise is terrible during voice call.Touch censor is very responsive, this also effects on call. You cannot adjust this buds during voice call as accidental touch will disconnect your call. Dont buy it for calling purpose.4 - Battery :- Battery life is very good. Buds it self provide 5 hours of non stop playing and 2-3 hours on calling. Case it self charge buds 4 times. Case can quickly charge buds and take 1.5 hours to Full charge the case.Build quality of buds is good. You can listen music while running and during exercise. Buds will not come out of your ears. Case quality is also good.So overall it is very good for listening music while running and walking, will give you good wireless experience.For calling purpose there are lots of other options available on amazon.

Worst ever product I have ever buyed on Amazon.Boult company every product is worst I am so sure.They are cheaters. The after buy service is horrible and harassing. I had buyed the product in may,it stopped working in June. Since then I am struggling at every stage. They made me wait for 20 days for return pickup. Till date I have not received my product back. When I wrote a review an executive called and they made me delete it saying yes yes we are working on it and all. Also horrible call center experience,they make us waits for ages ....Please don't fool yourself buying this product,you will only add stress after spending your hard earned money.

I bought these ear pods some time back and I am writing this review basis my experience.Its not noise cancelation ear pods. plus the sound quality is also not that great. it does get disconnected few secs between the call sometime. what I didn't like about this product is the design of the product. It keeps slipping out of my ear. I couldn't wear it for longer hours as then it hurts my ears.I would suggest buying Noise over boult as there is not much difference in the price.

Fair sound quality and noise cancellation.I liked the design and light weight of the product.Found an issue of the volume is reduced or increased automatically even when I was idle.At times I found that the device is not connected automatically to the phone.Mic is not performing as expected. Not catching much . Need to talk loud.

Product worked only for 6 months - not heavily used at all. One ear piece was not getting charged. Contacted customer service and we were asked to courier to Delhi address. I sent and was waiting and received another old black used one. we originally bought a white product. Not sure who used that before and been repaired now and sent to us to use it. Ideally they should repair my product and if not able to repair and replace with a new product, not send me another old one used by someone else. Absolutely no reply to your mails, all you get is automated template. Waste of time with Boult.UPDATE - June - 24thI received new sealed product which worked only for 2 days. I am done with this product.I have requested for refund for this product. Let see how we get there...PLEASE DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT ANYMORE@Amazon.in please remove this produce from your selling list.

Fit:It'll be fine if you are just sitting on your desk or bed and watching something on your TV or listening to music on your phone.I run everyday with it. Works fine until you start sweating.  When I sweat it keeps slipping out of my ears. Once one of them fell out of my ear and I had to spend a good 10 mins to look for them in the dark.Sound Quality:One word, 'Average'. There's nothing special about the sound quality.  I guess I am being a little too harsh considering they are around the Rs.2000 mark.One thing to notice is that they are not too loud. If you are in a crowded place even at max volume you might be disappointed.Touch Controls:Double tap pauses or resumes your music/video, triple tap plays the next/previous track depending on which earbud you are tapping on. Touch controls work fine except for the volume control.  To increase or decrease the volume you have to keep holding one of the buds and this is a hit and miss kind of thing. Sometimes it works but sometimes you have to press it again.Also, its takes a lot of time if you want to change volumes. Its a 5 second hold for one volume down or up which is irritating.Call quality: Horrible.  Most of the times the person on the other end is asking me to repeat what I am saying. I have to take out one of the earbuds and keep it in front of the mouth for to conversation to complete.Battery life:This is one thing which is as good as advertised.  Super battery life and USB type C makes it easier to charge as most of the most phones have Type C charging cable so you don't have to have one more cable lying around.

My experience with the product is not good.. The touch sensor for volme control is not working since the start.. I got it replaced. But again now 1 earphone batree dies within 50mins. Also the replaced product received seems second hand.Still more improvements can be done... Quite good product only if the product received is in its complete working condition.

Reviewing after 3 Months of usage:-Product was satisfactory for the price, though the sound quality was great, call quality was just as poor.. Couldn’t make clear voice from both caller’s end and receiver’s end.Poor touch control system.And the durability is worse. One earpiece stopped working after occasional use of 3 months.Faced connectivity issue, as even after keeping earpiece back into its case, it was still connected to my device, draining the battery of the devices.Now I’m afraid to spent money on any boult products.Not Satisfied.

Think 100 times before buying these airpods and don’t blindly fall for the product you purchase. Boult audio cannot be trusted as a good company and a good competitor as well. There are more competitors in the market who are producing more fine products then boult audio and there customer service is the worst of all,if you face any problem regarding your products then they will say just sent it to us by courier on your own even after your product is in warranty and will take 15-20 days to return your product after repairing and even after that they are not sure that your product will work as it was working when it was new. They can’t be trusted. So I request you all not to buy any of their product.

One of the worst customer service and product I have ever used. I bought Boult Audio AirBass Propods from Amazon on 25th Jan. Within 2 months charging pin has come out from the box. Pin came out while inserting the charger. When I called the customer care, I was told that its a physical damage. Yes, I agree its a physical damage and it will happen if Boult sends cheap and faulty products to customer. I had a lot of confidence on the product. Now I am geniunly wont recommend this product to anyone. Please dont by this product.. you will regret it later.

NOT SO GOOD PRODUCT FOR CALLING , music listening is good but thr call part is horrible. Even tried to talk through the mic by holding the earpods on the hand close to mouth but still it couldn't deliver thr sounds to the receiver. Such a disappointment.

Absolute GOLD!!! I mean they are literally THE best at this price point... Did lotta research before getting them and came to the conclusion that they have no alternative... Hence are the best at a price of 2000 INR. And pleaseeee don't go by the people or reviewers who say bass is average quality,or decent quality; I literally got my bones shaken while listening to it! There are lotta things that matter while talking about sound quality. Initially when I used them after unboxing the bass or the overall sound didnt seem to impress me,but THEN I switched the eartips from medium to large and then put them back in my ears. MASSIVE CHANGE! The bass ,the mids ,the highs and the overall wrapup of the audio just blew my mind! AWESOME! And yes,the touch controls and wake&pair feature work great!🤩 The battery life is also as promised... 4.5 hrs with the earbuds, you can charge them 4 times with case...BIG THANKS TO BOULT.

Boult Audio Airbass Propods has nice sound quality, vocals, etc.But bass quality is not satisfying if anyone needs intense bass. Noise cancellation is great in this price segment.In this product both the earbuds are master earbuds so we have option to use one at a time.According to my experience battery will stand for 5 hrs on one full charge. And case will charge four times. So we can get battery backup of 18-20 hrs. Which is not bad in this price range.Overall this product is very great. You should go for this if your budget is 3k.The service of Boult Audio is awesome. In order to know our experience or feedback they are personally contacting to the customers.Thankyou Boult Audio.

Be careful while purchasing I have received box which seal was tempered and on that white transparent tape was pasted. Means it clearly shows they have not given me brand new EarPods, moreover left pod is also not working, I have tried ya take this matter with amezon and seller but no one is ready to help. So be careful if you are thinking to bye this product and I would suggest not to bye as per my experience

I swear To God this was my first time buying TWS and the worst decision I ever made .... please don't Go for this it's the worst According to my experience 😡 Calling experience is the worst even inside room and Don't even think about making calls outside cause noise cancellation is worst the other person can't hear you only and they keep complaining about disturbance ..... right earbud keeps disconnecting again and again on its own without any reason .....worst wireless buds ever .....and now they are not even returning it ....I've made a replacement now let's see if the other ones are better or same more worst than these
"

The sound quality is good for the price range and has good punchy bass as well. There is no noise cancellation but there is noise isolation depending on the eartip fit and how secure it is. The sound seperation though not much can be felt with different types of eartips as well. There are certain issues with connectivity at times but it is common for TWS earbuds in this range to have this. The build quality is also good, it has a glossy finish to it although it looks like a matte finish in the pics. The mic quality is average and it picks up unnecessary background noises in certain areas like breeze or rattling utensils, etc. It's a good product nonetheless.

I won't refer this product to anyone, the first time i got this thing there was a problem with Bluetooth connectivity, i did a replacement and the second time the left earbud was not working. I placed a replacement again. But this time amazon gave me a refund instead of a replacement. I love amazon for their customer service, but the earphones disappointed me.

So, I got this product like some time back. I got 2 of them (my cousin uses the other). It worked perfectly fine for around some time and my product faced some issue. I got in touch with the customer service and they had send over a replacement when i sent over the product. Had faced some delay due to covid restrictions but the interaction and services were top notch.The product my cousin uses is still working perfectly fine.The audio quality as well as the fit and comfort is also good. The quality of the bass is very good to. All these parameters stand well above the standard which has been set for the price range.Overall ratings- 4.5/5

Guys I bought them recently and I'm going to share you all my experience. At first I just liked it's look and ordered it with out hesitation later I saw at reviews many are saying that sound quality is just ok in such a way I got feared but I just waited to test it myself and I got my product from Amazon recently. My first impression about sound is like it's awesome if you guys wanted to enjoy each and every instrument go for it but as it is Bluetooth we can't expect most base from it but it's awsome in this price range.simply go for it I can again edit after using of 7 days if cons is there in it

I would like to give my review for Boult airbass propods it has nicely overcome all my issues regarding earphone. It has really done well for me in this range that's very affordable with overall good performance. The touch controls are nice and sensitive. One point where I don't need to worry with boult is its fit in my ears. The sound quality is much better in this range however the noise cancellation is decent but its quality can be much more better. I have complain about its packaging i.e earbuds were not supported with any covering/ pack inside the main package of amazon felt like it was used one or any second product or there could be any physical damage but it was not actually it should be supported with the wrap inside so lesser change of any physical damage. Overall earbuds and its quality are nice as per my expectation. Thankyou 😊

For music and movies it's good but pathic for calls. Other person always complaint that voice is coming from distance or too low. On road you cannot use it for call. Product description mentions volume control but it's not there. Company confirmed it on mail that their products don't have volume control. Still they are mentioning it on product page. Bass is totally missing.  In total if you are buying it for music, it may be a choice but forget to use it for calls. I think other alternatives like boat, realme are far better. Even much older version of oppo pods is better.

Idk what the helll is happening to me. But these earpods work good for allmost 2 week but after sometime there sound quality and voice loudness getting dull and today after almost 3 months my right earbud stop working wtfff* i only use them for about 2 hours a day on gym 🗿 feeling so disappointed this is literally my worst decision i don't recommend these earbud to anyone and when i try to use my warranty card this card not working literally they are fraud

Worst brand I have seen everPurchased the Airbass Propods and it started showing charging issue within six month.I have raised the complaint and there was no response from Boult. Then I put review on Amazon and Google.After few days few executive from boult reached me and forcing me to delete the video and then only will replace your product. Those all executive was very rude specially Mr. Nasir.Boult did not replace my product and even was insisting me to delete the review. Pathetic service and worst product with brand.

These are a pretty good set of TWS. Do the job fine, have good amount of bass. The passive noise cancellation isn't all that great I would say. These don't cause any ear irritation or pain. The battery lasts for 5 hrs or so and the case lasts 2 days. The fast pair works good too. The touch surface seems  small and I have lost the count of how many times I tapped my ear instead the first 2 days, you get used to it eventually. I'd suggest you to invest a little more and buy realme buds pro because they have real noise cancellation and if that's what you're looking for.The microphone on this one is better than anything I've ever tried before, gotta give that to them.
"

Post using 30 days..Post viewing multiple videos to decide which pod should I go for under 2000, believe me this is the best product. Please charge the product when you receive and allow your ears to get use to it. Battery backup is excellent can be easily used for 2 days. Sound quality and calling experience is good.Under 2000 you can go for this product, 1 year warranty is available please register the same when you receive the product.

Just got the product. Got it way cheap during the sales.Looks is good.Designs are awesome love the stem design and the matte finish on the case.Sound quality is good too.The only drawback is call quality.The other end complain of my voice being low.Overall with this price i would say it ok to buy for work out and jogging but not going to be very efficient for calling purposes.Update after 2days right bud stopped working. Now waiting for refund won't buy boult.

Am quite impressed with the propods. Sound clarity is good with balanced bass and treble. Noise cancellation is passive but effective and the battery life is pretty good. The case can charge the propods up to 4 times and I’ve used the propods continuously up to 4 hours and the battery hasn’t run out.The ear buds are comfortable too and didn’t cause any ear pain . The controls are something one needs get used to and after a while they’re ok.All in all , Boult has done a good job and has delivered an outstanding products. Boult customer service is also quite good and responsive. I had a few queries and they responded courteously and quickly .Amazon was up to the mark on shipping and packaging as well. Am happy with the product .

Hey there,I've recently purchased the earbuds of white color and i liked white looks better and premium instead of black because the black one comes with Matt finishing when white comes with shiny material so for me it looks better!!! Apart from the overall quality of the earbuds is decent.

Bass Quality 3/53. Noise Cancellation 4/54. Comfortable 4/55. Calling quality 4/56. Battery Backup 4/5Pros:-The sound is decent the vocal and mids sounds crisp and clear-The earbuds are too light to wear-Overall it will look premium the material of buds and case.-Battery backup is Extremely Good I've Got 5 Hours Of Backup With Single Charge.!!-Touch Sensor works well.!!Cons:-Bass is not what is expected-Sometimes we need to connect both earbuds to eachother-The Speech Of Connected Disconnected Feels CheapOverall Summary- This is worth buying in this price range you can go with them if you don't like much bass and want clear and crisp sound!! :)) Just Go For It.!!🤑🤑If anyone wanna know more regarding the earbuds they can just text me on instagram: dharmitt_shah

Defective product was delivered. Microphone was not working on both buds. After replacement, still got a defective product, left mic was not working. I had no other choice but to return the product.Sound quality is goodBass is okayNoise cancellation is okayDesign is good but it doesn't feel premium. At this price range, we cannot expect more than this.Touch controls are good.Amazon package was not up to the mark.Seller: Appario retail private limited, disappointed with your service. I don't know how the quality checking is done but on both the occasions, I have received a defective product.

I bought it at a risk as there were no reviews. Luckily, I made the right choice. The buds check off all my 'need' factors and are the best in the segment with some really good attributes. There are some issues but with the price point, it doesn't matter as I did a lot of research before buying and no other buds at this price point offer the same quality Boult Probuds are providing.-----Detailed Analysis------Pros1. Sound Quality: Really crisp audio with above-average bass quality. Won't disappoint. The maximum volume is on a lower side but is loud enough for me. ( I anyway use it at 70% with no problem)2. Call Quality: Best in the segment. Every other earbud in the segment has a problem with calls but not this. No active noise cancellation but the mics on the buds allow for clear transmission.3. Design and Ergonomics: Good. Fits perfectly but might vary with different ear sizes. But you can change the rubber to get a better fit(you can get the rubber from any shop). Also doesn't create a problem with sweat(Used it for an hour of jogging with excessive sweat). Also, it's super comfortable unlike other buds in the segment.4. Battery Life: Really good. Gave me around 5.5 hours at (70-90)% battery. The charging case is also very good. Charged my buds from 40% to 70% in 10 minutes. So with 4 full charges from the case, expect around 20 hours of battery.Cons.They  are literally few like the bass is not so enhanced but worth 2499

Overall at this price point, the Boult Airbass Propods are a good choice for the average music listener. Highs, lows and mids are clearly discernible and the 3 sets of TPU/Silicone earbuds would cater to almost any ear size. Packaging is neat, however I would have preferred if the charging case felt a little more durable. The Propods charge quickly enough and sound good in a quiet or noisy setting.The only issue I have seen until now is answering calls on the iPhone. The mics don’t seem to be picking up my voice (will need to test more). But since I prefer less of voice calls, the earphones are quite a satisfying purchase for me. Overall happy with the music output for my ears and they stay in the ear!! No more falling out while walking!!

The moment the battery drained out and I put it on charge again the buds don't seem to be charging ... I don't understand why ?I was extremely happy with the sound quality and bass and every thing about it untill this and now the replacement window says it's shut ???Guys !!! I banked on you only to get a defective piece ..All was well untill it went out of the charge which came of from the box .. it even lasted long with minimal usage but the moment the battery drained out so did my trust in the boult audio.

I have been using the Boult Audio Airbass propods for almost 8 months now and this is an absolute honest review.1. SOUND QUALITYThere is no doubt that the Boult Audio Airbass propods is one of the best truly wireless earpods out there within your budget. For those of you who are looking for a balanced sounding earpods can definitely get your hands on it.If you are not a huge bass lover and love rich audio quality and clarity can get your hands on the Propods2. DESIGN AND COMFORTThere is no issue with the design and comfort of the Airbass propods. I have even used it for an entire day while traveling without any discomfort.3. CALL QUALITYWhat I felt though is that the calling quality on this earpods are 'AVERAGE' and Boult should work on improving it on the next version that it launches.It does not have proper sound cancellation thus the other person on the call can hear your ambient noise more than your voice. However, there are few third party apps out there which can fix the problem upto some extent.4. BATTERY BACKUPI have never faced any issues with the battery. The Airbass propods can easily last upto 3 and half to 4 hours. There is also an option to charge it through the case atleast 2 to 3 times thus giving you an additional backup of upto 12 to 14 hours. The battery backup is practical enough even if you are travelling.VERDICTSound clarity 👍Bass 👍Battery backup 👍Call quality needs improvement 👎

Super dynamic bass, clear tone, perfect beats.. BUT.. there's some latency issue with this and if it gets fixed, trust me.. it's the best than any other TWS.

Boult Audio Airbass Propods, these ear pieces stand true to their specifications. My 2nd pair of Boult Audio devices. This one features more optimisation for better use. The audio devices individual ear pieces are both Master which is well received as it can function independently of itself and does not rely on each other. The built quality is top notch for the price and easy on hands. The design to is interesting to use and does go well with the audio. Extra Bass though not punchy but compared to other devices much better. Overall a great piece of own. Though continuous listening can cause some pain points in your ear but that's true for any in-ear piece. Shouldn't affect your buying decision. Just something for the brand to work on.

After using this for 1 year i have changed my review. There was excessive battery drain from both earbuds. I managed to get a replacement as it was within the warranty period. Im not sure if it was a replacement or a repaired piece as the buds looked ok but there were marks on the case. The battery lasts justs about for over 3 hours and not more. The touch controls are pathetic- if you tap it once, the volume keeps increasing or decreasing continuously. Will not recommend Boult to anyone. Go for other options please....

Hello! I received this product on 16 April 2021. Yeah! It's been 2 months. For this 1st one month it was working smoothly. The one problem was switching between iPad and my phone. After that the microphone quality became worse. The people I was talking to in my phone complained of cranky voice. Then, the battery was not able to hold power for long. I used OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z before this. That was awesome. If you could pay 300rs. more please consider that one. Thanks!😄

I bought this to try out how an ear pods would do for me before buying something expensive. Gotta say better than expected. The audio quality is OK for a wireless device. The ear pods are very comfy. But the pairing is where it would be an Issue for IOS users. It's very slow at pairing every time. And the touch controls are gimmicky. Won't even pause a song.

To start with these are my first pair of tws. I never opted for them thinking that sound will not be good as I am a Sennheiser cx 180 fan but after my audio jack broke I did bit of research and settled for these.. and may I tell you they have very good sound quality I really am impressed.... Fitting is good too and by replacing ear buds with large size ones noise reduction gets better. Overall good pair of tws ... Should definitely go with these if you are a newbie like me.. won't get disappointed.

The sound quality is good but the touch is utter nonsense. Every time I keep hearing beep and keeps getting active on its own.I am tired of hearing it -and mind you I have just started to use it and I am already pissed with beep noise.The power too is bad - even when it's fully charged it keeps announcing low battery charge the pods.I regret this purchase and I can't even return it.

The overall sound quality at this price point is amazing.Best for people who like clean and crisp audio and nominal bass.There was a problem regarding the charging of pods which I faced after 2 months of use, but boult people registered my request as it was in warranty and replaced the product within a week.

I have been using these TWS for a week now and I'm just satisfied with buds. Build quality is good of the case and earphones as well. The hinge click is satisfying and matte finish looks good. Sound quality is ok but not great. Bass is boosted and bass lovers will love the output. But sounds seperation is terrible. And the worst of it is the calling quality, all the calls which I made through this TWS I had complaints gorom the other end that my voice is very low and the other other person was not able to hear me clearly. Not recommended of you want to use these TWS primarily for calling purpose

Hello guys,So I have taken a month to write the correct review after being personally experience it.Positive :1. Looks and body is very elegant which gives the premium look.2. Softly adjusted ear plugs and doesnt cause any pain or fall even using for long hours.3. Sound quality is clear and perfectly production of sounds in balanced manner4. It charges very fast in its port, I guess full charge in 10-15 min which goes pretty long hours5. Its port itself charge very quickly and keep its battery for long.6. Very handy and easy to carry even in your pocket.7. It connects to the bluetooth within 5 sec when you open the case which is pretty awesome.8. Noice cancellation  is perfectly worksNegative/Neutral1. The touch is very sensitive, which you will get use to it after using for a while.I brought it after using many other brands and after reviews as well and now I can sy I am completely satisfied as of now.

Good product in segment but not best as mentioned in specifications. Then are mentioning 4-5 hours play time but will be down within 3 hours.

"
4221,"
When I first bought it, the sound was on and off, this relates to the bluetooth connectivity. Now it's better but the range strength I feel still could be better. Also depends on  the walls/area's materials. When right next to the device it's ok. It glows/blinks periodically when on, as shown in pic. The tap feature works. Packaging is good. Mine came with pink tinge on the inside idk why, does not affect the hardware though. Got it at a deal, wouldn't pay full price for it/either wait for a discount or buy another one.At this price point however it is good, I have been using it as an on the go device, when earphones w wires were a bit restricting and also while sleeping on bed and pooping also lol (for real), don't have to carry mobile, etc.

The propods are pretty decent when to comes to regular music listening or streaming. Doesn't provide the best bass drop one looks for while in the gym but is pretty decent. The build quality is a little fragile though. The touch sensitivity is not up to the mark and one of the propods has already stopped responding to the touch controls. This is my first truly wireless earbuds purchase so I would say look for other buds if they are the same price but if not, these are a decent choice for your first purchase.

 After 6 months of use:- Product's performance has reduced exponentially. Batter backup reduced to 25-30 min on full charge.Sound has started to distort alot.Worst part is that on their website price has reduced to Rs 899/- whereas I purchased it at Rs 1999/- from amazon.Product is not that good. Sound quality is average with a little bass..Pairing system is good.. Touch is receptive and fast.. Battery backup is surely a good one.But you cannot talk using these as half of ur sentence will reach the next side and so having a conversation is very much difficult..For noise cancellation I will give 7/10.Fitting is good but while doing heavy exercises it tends to come out.. So precautions have to be taken..Overall better product than this one are there so make sure to check ur priority..

Not good as expected, base quality is bad, microphone is not working,voice quality is not good as well. After complaining, they replaced the product after 3/4 month. Please think twice before buying a boult product. Worst Customer service facilities. #BOAT is far most better than boult.

Its A very good Tws. I had bought Many Tws But I Like it very much. Due to its sound quality.And the bass is Very good.Pros: The Battery Backup is Very Good . I Had just Charged once when i bought and still now it is running. Though i am using rough and tough the battery backup is so much.According to me i can use that much of battery backup for more than 2 daysCons: Call Quality is very Poor.The other side on the call will not recive the voice while you are talking.  Boult Should Improve this.

Overall it’s a good product. But noise cancellation during calls is poor. One who is very concerned about the noise cancellation should not go for this product. Otherwise it’s a pretty good product for listening to music and videos. Personally I don’t play games so I won’t comment on that. But I am just dissatisfied with the noise cancellation. If it’s a noisy place the other person will have to struggle to listen to you. But in a silent area it works fine.

The pro pods are good looking with excellent sound. I played gamble while buying these pods as compared to the competition but now while using them I believe the gamble was worth playing for. There is some issue I am facing in controlling the volume through pods which is disappointing. overall the built is good, nice battery back up, connects very fast with phone, nice lights on the case. However, overall a good buy in this price segment.

The product I initially received had some malfunctions like the volume increased and decreased randomly and there were delays in the sound. I left a bad review here, customer service called and said if I remove this review they would send me a replacement, I did and then they stopped replying. Today the earphones have completely stopped connecting to any phone. Complete rubbish. Please save your money, and buy something better.

This product is just brilliant.Call Quality is amazing, the other person can hear you clearly.Bass is just super... Totally loved it... Vocals are heard very clearly... Design is awesome... The case charges the buds upto 4 times and in single charge gives upto 4 hour backup... Just go for it...

• Great sound stage.• Wonderful fit, finish and packing.• Great Value for money• Bought 2 (1 White and 1 Black) of these and very happy with performance• Go for it if you are ok without loudest headbanging bass - this is coming from a bass lover. I don't miss out the loud bass - for me bass is balanced just right. Rest can be tuned using wavelet app.• Only if it was completely made in India, I would have loved it even more but at least it is a product by an Indian company.• A flat and longer charging cable (it's USB C) would have been great.

This is genuine review and I am writing after using two months.-- Battery life is around 4-5 hour with single charge and you get 24 additional hour with this case.-- Fit good in ears.-- The bud do not fall during travelling or workout.-- Noise cancellation for call is decent, I spoke over a call for 30-35 minutes and the call quality is good.-- Most loved part is that it was small and we will not feel that we are caring in our pocket of tight jean's.-- 4.1/5(Overall)  Sound 4/5  Function- 4.5/5  Build Quality - 4/5 for case and 4.5/5 for  earbuds.  Call Quality - 3.9/5-- Gesture work fine.-- Range upto 5 metre-- Base 4/5 (Not heavy bass but overall sound quality is good)...considering the price tag it is good, I definitely recommended this product

It's a very good item, i am fully satisfied with it, each and every feature is best in this price range, fully touch control, touch calibration is very accurate, call quality also impressive, sound quality is very clear with extra bass, battery life is longer as mentioned, charging case quality also very good and magnetic top with open and auto pairing facilities, it's has Type-C charging port with fast recharge, i found more than 7hrs battery backup in 80% volume level.

Good product 👍 great quality of bulid, rich bass, fits well in ears, audio quality wireless connection is aslo great, price is also worthy.

Firstly the audio quality of the headphone was great, good bass decent mids and highs and it also supports AAC codec which is great for this price rangeBattery life is also goodCall quality is ok but u cant do the whisper level talks which is not available in almost all of TWS around this price rangeBut the biggest problem with the headphone is its sloppy touch controls because whenever i try to put it on it summons the google assistant and the worst u ll end up reducing the volumeIf not foe this sloppy touch controls this would be the best choice in this price range.

Packaging was damaged with some kind of liquid,  it felt like it was used .After 2 months of use the ear pieces dont disconnect even after closing the putting them in the case and closing it.

Writing this after 4-5 months using it..The earpods automatically disconnects..Touch sometimes don't even responseOn-call voice to other party sounds like the person using Boult pods are sitting in small vacant room .. voice clarity is very poor..Initial months performance was good so didn't write anything about it..But yeah it's good looking pod
"
4243,"
Sound quality is good.Pairs easily.Would be better if they increase the Max volume.Battery is good.Only problem I faced is if I touch the pods to adjust it in the ear, the music stops and opens the Google assistant.Apart from that doesn't have additional buds. Cause for me my left ear is a bit smaller than the right one. So often I adjust it as it didn't come with multiple bud pairs.

Product worked great for 6 odd months. Had a good sound quality, but after 6 months the right pod stopped charging and it’s touch stopped working. I called the customer care 3-4 times but did not get any reply, further I emailed them and it has been 3 days and I haven’t gotten any reply.
"
4245,"
Nice earphones. Snug fit into the ears. Good packaging. Decent sound.What I didn’t like - the pod requires a C type charging wire and the package contained a regular USB charging wire. Cud be an error but strange when so many things in the box are packed to perfection .
"
4246,"
I bought this for music listening so that I don't have to take the trouble of wires. It's sounds ok but it's fitting on my left ear just hurts my ear it's due to my left ear bone just outward a little but so it hurts like crazy after 15 mins of use and that defeats its purpose. And one more thing it's thouch panel is so weirldly placed that while adjusting my buds it usually detects a touch although it's fine while watching vids but while calls it disconnect the calls. And once the touch pane stopped working and then started working after I put them into the case and then charged them for a min or so. Another problem is that if the case's battery dies but the ear buds have battery it you then take out the buds it won't pair them as they have insta wake up pair feature which don't work without battery of the case 👎👎

3 days of use and the ProPods seem good to me.. the connectivity is super fast and very convenient. Battery backup isbalso good. The sound is pretty moderate and not too loud as well. The best thing is the comfort in the ear. After a while you will stop noticing that you have them in your ears.Edit: A week of usage and I noticed the biggest con: calling. The other person on call is never able to hear me properly even when I am inside. One other thing is the feature of single touch to disconnect the call. If during the call you try to adjust the bud in your ear, a tiny touch will disconnect the call which annoyed me. It should have been double touch instead.

Battery didn't last long not suitable for calls  and the functions are bad but still it's good product at each pricing suitable for just listing sounds good stylishFor longevity you already have the power backup at each case . You can own it if you're gonna just listen to songs or watch movies.

Writing the review after the use of product for 3 Months almost. Earlier I've been using the BOULT MONOPOD and the product is damn good and still using the same, and that's why went again for BOULT.The BOULT PROPODS are again a damn good product with a great build quality (case too), music quality, calling features and for everything.This is the best product under 2k, and I would highly recommend to go with it.
"

Handy and innovative product, but Boult has one thing very poor and that is mic. The voice doesn't reach the mic properly when on a call.There is always a complaint regarding the poor quality of sound on the other side. Not to be purchased if calling feature is a priority.

I had purchased this product, after 15 to 20 days I had face charging issues so I contacted boult service center, they said send the product at Delhi center, i has been done by courier 150 rs.

So I throw them into scrap. Don't buy this product.Boult person if you are read this review please 🙏 can you refund my money 💰  1199+150=1349

This is the worst product to buy ever. In my experience, there is nothing right about the product at the price it comes for.I sent the product for issues one week after I bought them from Amazon. And, the issues still exist.The service is very inconvenient as there are no physical service centres and you have to courier the propods on their address.The sound quality is again average. I have used Boat airpods at a similar price range and they are much better. The charging ports in the case are very lose and every time you put the pods in the case, you have to see if they are charging.

Please do not buy this product if you want to take calls. The microphone quality is very poor and also gets disconnected from Bluetooth connection frequently. I returned and got a replacement.

I have been using this TWS EARBUDS for almost 2 months and this is an honest review:Pros:1. It has a really good sound quality.2. The build quality is Average (but taking the price in mind it is good)3. The bass the better than I expected.4. Battery life is good ( I get 18-20 hours if play back time)5. It fits into the year perfectly and doesn't fall off. It is good for gym purposes.Cons:1. I face serious trouble with its connection.  The connection of this earbuds with laptops is pathetic. It never gets connected properly. Only one earbud gets connected at a time. Sometimes it pauses music by its own. Then we have to connect it from the beginning2. The mic is average I didn't find it so great. We have to speak loudly into it.Also sometimes when u call your buds don't connect to the mic, so we have to restart the phone and then connect it again.3. Sometimes the touch control doesn't respond. As far as I have seen, this happens to me rarely.Overall: (out of 5)Sound- 4Battery - 4Connection - 4(with mobile phones)Connection - 1( with laptops)Mic - 3Comfort - 4*Overall, this is one of the best earbuds under this price range, it has really good features even at this price. I really loved the buds and I'm using it daily. It also look really stylish.Thank You

I bought this product for online classes. I liked that it instantly connects once the case is opened. It has a good range. The packaging is good with three different sizes of earbuds and an authentic warranty card. The charge is for 1.5 hours when propods are in use. The case is compact and holds charge. The mic quality is okay. Noise cancellation is weak. At first, the bass quality was fine. After few weeks, the overall product quality declined. The sound quality became poor. I have to hear the bass/music in full volume on the phone to be audible. Sometimes, the call volume have to be increased to full volume to hear the other person too. Mic quality is also very low. Cleaning the ear mesh has not been instructed well in the manual even though as troubleshoot, it has been advised.

I purchased the boult audio propods 2 days back and have been using it extensively for all my calls from thenPros:1. Easy to pair & use2. Fits in perfectly into your ear canal3. Sound quality is good for the price4. Noise cancellation is at par and people on other side were able to hear properly with minimum issues5. Bass is good not great,  however i cant complaint as it is good for the price i paidCons:1. The touch panel is very sensitive and sometimes it does act even if i am trying to fit in the pods in to my ears.

The amazon as well as boult's own website and youtube tells you that the earbuds have volume adjustment feature present for touch controls, but the product I received had this feature missing from the manual as well as earphoneEven all the touch controls (although matching with the manual) were different than what boult tells on their youtubeBuy on your own risk. Although I have asked for a replacement, yet to see if the replacement is actually what they promised.

Sound quality is adequate but not too good and the worst thing is noise cancellation as the noise cancellation is so bad that even if you are sitting in your room talking to someone still that person will be able to hear the disturbing traffic noise or even the mildest noise of surrounding..very disappoited buying this..moreover while talking on phone our voice isn't clear to the person we are talking with and hence we have to literally raise our voise in such a manner that people surrounding us thinks that we are fighting on phone.

First I have 2 stars... But now reducing one..Yesterday they called me and asked to delete this review... What is this ??Pros-1)build quality is good2)noise cancellation is best3)sound quality is good Cons-1)bass quality not up to the mark.2)mic does not work properly, the person on the call cant hear you clear, it's like you had put your mic far away from you and then speaking3)battery backup is just ok, it will last long max 5 hours after full charging.4)getting disconnected in between the call.5)while talking on the call, the voice gets cut in between.Overall, I purchased it for my comfort and use for office work, which is calling, but it did fail me.Not up to the money value.

At first when I got my product my mic wasn't working while calling then I had issues regarding the volume sometimes it would go up or down automatically after getting it replaced the new pair of buds i got one of them stopped working in 6m not at all durable and I would not recommend the reader to go ahead and buy it .Having said the above no doubt the sound quality of the buds are amazing but the other issues spoilted it for me

If you're looking for an amazing truly wireless earphone that:1. Fits in your ear (has vaccuum stops rather than plastic ends)2. Is relatively cheaper (I got it for 2.3 k)3. Has a good range of connectivity4. Has clear sounds and not too much bass (Bass is decent enough but not too much for someone who lives for dham dham in their music)5. Is portable with a cute charging case6. Offers good battery supportThen, look no further and go for it! This will surprise you!Cons:I did have a bit of a problem when connecting it to my laptop. Sometimes the audio broke for a few seconds but I disconnected and connected again and it sounded fine afterwards.The touch controls are also something you will either get used to or get annoyed at times because Google assistant keeps opening up when I just want to change songs.But these are not deal breakers. Go for it! I'm so happy to have found it. Great job, Boult! 😊

 Hey people ! I am a professional music producer and to be honest the first impression of the propods is premium with matt black scratch proof built quality and the sound quality but when I started using it on daily basis, it made me love it more!!! Some cons that we can consider are :1) Bass is great but goes flat at one point after reaching ultra high hz +.2) 70% crisp sound only remaining 20% is EQ Effect and 10% live noise cancellation.3) Your ears gonna take atleast 2 days to get used to it for long use then it feels like a body part.Pros for propods :1) Isolates you from the outer environmental sounds.2) Volume is harmless even at top ends.3) Bass is Good | Better | Best  /\4) Fits into ears perfectly just gives you pain in the starting but your ears will get used to it after 2 days of use.Buy this pods they are worth it.

Connectivity wise .. they are really good for the price. Sound quality is decent too..they are not very loud which is a bummer but what pisses me off the most is that bass is entirely missing....feels like my music is just a bit plain ....They could have been better but I guess that's the most u could expect from budget tws.... One more thing to mention is that the build quality is really good and the unboxing experience too was really great .. Just a little plain sounding but overall they are good👍🏻

The touch area is too sensitive and sometimes the voice assistant gets triggered when you don’t want it to also it used to accidentally end the calls which can get really annoying... When it comes to battery backup I can say that it has a much better battery backup than the realme buds air, but the microphone’s quality isn’t that clear as the other person could hardly hear my voice at certain moments, and there’s no ENC so all the background noises can be heard which could make it too annoying for the other person, so for calls I’d suggest you to go for Realme buds air. I’m not a bass lover so the level of bass isn’t a problem for me. It’s neither high nor low, but it is good enough to enjoy the music. Overall if you want an earbuds for just listening to music and want a good battery backup, then these propods are just the earbuds for you! Also the plastic quality didn’t feel that much premium for me, and the case seems quite fragile due to the quality of plastic they have used in it so I’ll have to take a good care of it... As they fit me comfortably as compared to that of the realme buds air which after an hour or so starts hurting my ears, these propods don’t and I can wear them for longer period, also since it has the silicon eartips it can provide you a passive notice cancellation which is good for listening to music in noisy environments... overall I’d say they are a good pair of earbuds for casual listeners with a good battery life and decent sound quality but they are not good for making calls.

I have bought the Propods on 16th Nov’21. It’s not even been one month that I have started getting charging issues on these.I have tried so many times but the propods are not charging properly. There seems to be some connection issue. Once I put these propods inside the case, they should automatically start charging. But they don't. They are out of charge now and I have no way to charge them.It defeats the whole purpose of buying them. I want a refund of my money

The overall experience is good. As the price of product is 1999/- I don't think to expect more at this price value.

It is a total crap that this Boult is running. Importing cheap Chinese products and selling it to us.It's been just a couple of months and my right earbud has stopped working nor it is getting charged.

This is definitely not what we expect as a customer.For me it was a omplete wastage of money.Do refrain yourself from buying this is cheap quality products from Boult

The packaging is awesome.You get a usb C type cable and 2 extra ear buds.The box is also small wnough to get into your pocket and not make a big bulge.Initial impressions with the fit and sound are excellent.Pairing was super smooth and the volume is loud enough to cancel quite a lot of noise.The size of it's tail is also not too long and not too short.For this price, I think these are really good earphones.P.S. I was one of the first customers of Boat earphones and at that time they were selling cheap I think Boult is also at the same stage, buy it before these price up.

Worst earbuds ever! Touch sensors are just over sensitive! Your calls will mostly get rejected with your hairs touching the buds. The latency of this product is like 1 or 2sec. Not at all suitable is you are planning to use these even for minor gaming. Mic quality is horrible. There is a lot of distortion. Even bluetooth doesn't catch every word u speak. Also the earbuds keep on falling from your ears. No grip at all. Sound quality isn't the best but it's still useable. Overall ratings for the product is 0.5/5.

These propods look very sleek and finely crafted. Fit well in the ears and the audio quality is quite good. Auto-pairing happens in a fraction of second.Mic however doesn't work as seamlessly. Voice is not clear at other end of call and one has to speak loudly.Battery performance is yet to be seen. But just with calls, lasts for Day.

There was no seal on the box , buds case was pretty dirty and inside the box there were scratches on the hinge.As for earbuds its overall good compared to other products in this range. U might find some problem fitting it in the ears , gives some hell of a pain . Bluetooth range ,connection speed and reaction time are all average.It is certainly not for gaming , if u r buying this for playing online games then i prefer not to . Especially not for FREE FIRE And PUBG .Bass is good.

I bought these pods in the prime sale just for 1999/-. The sound quality is awesome. It has a standard sound. Not too over bass not over treble either. Also they are very comfortable in the ears and can be use for running and in the gym too. The battery life is awesome, they last for alteast to days with the case. Watched movies as well they did not prompt any battery low warning after using it for 2-3 hours continue usage as till date. Have been using them since a month now. If you are a bass lover they are not for you best they have a very good quality of sound.

This is a great product if bought under 2k.It has a great connectivity noise cancellation.Till now no i have not faced any issues regarding these earphones.It has a bit low bass.Sometimes the volume too feels low on 60% - 90%.At 100% the sound may leak on heavy songs (which include high bass, vocals etc)Talking about its battery. It has a huge battery packup the earbuds last around 6 - 7 hoursI have not tested the backup of the case till now. The comfortablity of the earbuds is the major pro point.It is overall a good product id bought under 2k.Better than boult audio freepods.

The sound quality and noise cancelation is far better for hearing audios. The bass quality is also good for listening musics with a perfect record quality. The one small issue observed occasionally is the quality of microphone and the sensitivity of the touch buttons. The touch button is highly sensitive and it got disconnected while putting the buds to the ear once the call is receiving. On other side It is also an advantage ,can easily managed using a single soft touch. Now synch with it through practice. This is a good option in this segment worth for the price.

The right propod loses the touch control feature after I used it for half a month. I can't even turn it on or off without the charging case, I have to carry the case all the time.it's not really convenient to return it on my own to the company where I have to pay all courier charges. so I am adjusting to it. well, the left one is still working, and the sound quality is good.overall it's a good earbud in the budget, but the one-year warranty they offer is not very promising

This latest product of boult audio feels premium and comfortable in ear. Its made up of good quality plastic and has a glossy finish , connectivity and battery life is pretty good but sound is descent and it lacks bit bass and thump but treble, and instrument separation is quite good. Lets talk about touch controls i personally feel bit annoying when i struggle to -/+ volume instead i end up activate google assistant, i wonder i can turn off this gesture in earbuds  although, its a great product and value for money go for it. It won't disappoint uh for battery connectivity and sound quality

Effectively one of the best twins I ever had, These twins has more battery life than my other twins. These have better noise cancelation, sharper sound which stands out and also quality of phone calls also okay. But I think these twins are best.But I have only one con according to these twinsI. E. After using this for fifteen days, my left propod had stopped connecting to my phone, I have to try many times to the propod to the phone and also when I kept them in my charging case the left one is not getting charged. Apart from that I have no issue with this propods

Writing this review as Rishabh Bhargava. The product is simply fantastic. I just loved it. And sound quality and other voice vocals are loud and clear. The main thing I do with this is to attend calls. And I would like to mention BOULT has given me the best caloing quality till now on any bluetooth buds.It is fantastic and I m loving it. You should surely give this a try and believe me you would love it.

I particularly order this propods for its shorter stem length. But I am surprised with its audio quality which is par my expectation. Device connection is quick, the propods stays well in ears while sporting activities which is a very good plus point which I was looking for, while audio quality is good. You may want to tweak equaliser of your audio app for best output from Boult propods. Noise cancellation is again quite good. Over all value for money product.

I have been using these for almost 6 months.. and now i think its time for a review. The thing u hear its really isnt bass.. its just the thumping sound of frequecy higher than 50 hz or some what. It proved its water resistance well. Worst paor of earphones if you are planning to use them for running. Good ones if you are planning to listen conference or online class. Drop a few times the earbud' stem base breaks but u could insert it back again.

This is my first tws earphones ...nd i love thm coz they fullfill all my requirements....like size,case style,battery,touch and c type charger. I was so confused while buying ....but they satisfy all my demands.The ones who want buy for calling thn u mst go for sm other option because its touch doesnot works well in calling....i dont need them much  for calling so they satisfy.If u r new nd finding one obly for listening songs nd watching vedios without being bounded to the wires thn u should go for them...they r bst in this range.

After 2 months of use I am updating my initial review of recommending this product. The charge back up and the connectivity between the pods are not in sync always. I am also facing that the left EarPods drain charge quickly. Not a product to bank your bucks on for INR2k opt for an alternative

The sound quality be it voice call or music is just awesome. Battery backup is very high and it. Supports quick charging, so i always find it ready to use.They offer buda of 3 different sizes in the case. A c-typr usb cable, pod holder, manual and warranty card.

I did a little research and review before buying, which i usually do before buying any product. Wad sceptical on buyin after reading the review about the Bass.

The bass is good and the battery life is amazing.Over all is an amazing product for this price. The look of case & pods is good.

Mic is good if you speak loud, Mic automatically cancels the low voice and other person can not hear you properly,  saler calling staff girl contacted me and asked to change my review comment and give it 5 star if I want to get it replaced..bad sound quality,  bad base quality, poor noise cancelation, this product is waste of money....don't waste your hard earned money
"

I was reading a lot about different models in the market for a decent price. This one caught my eye because of its sleek design but I wasn't sure about the quality. But with the first look, I was happy with the product.The soundbass quality is good and clear. Even with one pod, u can still use all the features. Although there is no distinct setting for noise cancellation, it covers the background noise. It fits perfectly in your ears. The charging box is handy and perfect to carry around. It provides 5 hrs of continous charge. The touch tabs are very sensitive. Sometimes it gets moved to next action, if you accidently touch your ear especially when u are on a call it can get disconnected.Overall, its a great product from Boult. I can move around easily doing my work while enjoying continous sound. I wouldn't mind buying a second one.

I really liked the product. I am writing this review after using it for more than 10 days now and I really want to mention that it is a very satisfying experience.Bass is truly amazing. Sound quality is soo good.Nice cancellation is not as expected but it does it job in the price segment.All the services are touch control and the options surprised me as it covers maximum everything a ear buds can deliver.Happy that I chose this.

The first delivery had a defective piece where the right bud was not working, had to order for a replacement. Got it the very next day and hassle free. For the given price point (plasticy feel and the discounted price do not equate themselves). That being said, the sound, treble are pretty good, can do better on bass perspective..charging and connectivity are decent enough to get the work done.

Pros : Fits goodNoise cancellation okay okaySound - Bass could be better, but won't disappoint when you listen good music songs.Design - it's just wowBattery - if not continuous user then won't disappoint you at all. Easily 3 charge plus pods can give you more then 3 hrs+Cons : while talking on calls, it could be better in noisy background.I think this is what I don't like in this pods , otherwise it's 4.5/5But my ratings is 4/5But as per my knowledge , this is totally worth it in this price.

As someone who's always been skeptical of using truly wireless earbuds, I'm so happy with this purchase! It has a snug fit with perfect sound quality, amazing bass and good for escaping noisy situations with great noise cancellation. It doesn't slip out of ears even if you've been exercising. It took me some time to get the settings right with the touch control but once you're used to it, you love it. The best thing is that I got these for an affordable price of ₹1,999 with great qualities. Way better than Apple Airpods. 10/10 would recommend all to buy ASAP :)
"
4326,"
The product is really good for its price range. To be frank, the sound quality is really nice. And of course people have different music choices, talking about the bass quality, i am not a pure bass lover so I feel the bass these pods offer me is more than enough. if you're a pure bass lover, and buying this product only for its bass quality as mentioned, this might not be your best choice. but the overall sound clarity is really good and energising. I would ask you to go for it if you're not looking only for its bass. Have a good day.

I bought Boult Audio propods few days back. I'm not satisfied with the product, though there are Good features like;1. Light weight2. Fits in ear well, doesn't fall3. Bass is Good4. Compact designCons:1. Disconnecting during call (rare) or only one earbud is working2. Turns on google assistance often while adjusting ear(I'm irritated!!)3. No immersing sound effects! (Even a Rs.1000 earphones do better)4. China Product5. Cracking voice during calls4. Poor Battery life (giving around 3 hrs only, for Rs.8000 worth Product)I can only give you 3 star of 5.

5 start for its comfort design and durability. Even sound quality is also good for this price range. One drawback of this product is passive noise cancellation. This feature is not at all helpful. This will amplify the background noise while we are calling and which will affect the conversation. I wish they had a feature or software update to turn off the noise cancellation.  Other than this issue rest all are good for these earbuds

Well, if you would to get a set of earpods that would work for less than 2 months, go for it. Mine lasted for like 2 months after which i claimed warranty, the company picked up my headphones after a month's time via courier and received a new set for almost after 2 months and voila the new ones lasted for 2 months again. My advise would be to look for an alternative.

Being a student and music lover, I was looking for some budget-friendly TWS earphones with good sound quality and bass. So I ordered these pair of Bluetooth earphones on the Amazon sale and got these at a very decent price. To start with, these pairs sound truly great with a neutral sound and good bass. Battery life is also good and the best part is the fit of these earphones. Also, it comes with a USB c type charging which is plus point.Overall I would recommend these pair of propods to anyone looking for a budget-friendly and good neutral sound.

Absolutely a crap. It isn’t worth a penny. If it’s bought for listening music 🎶still it is a worthless product. What to talk about  its calling quality. And touch sensor OMG! It seems that the R&D team was busy in partying when the assembling and fabrication of this product were in progress.

Call quality is very bad,, no voice cancellation. This is not good for calling purpose.. you will get minimal bass in this . Pairing is not very fast and some times it never get paired ,you have to do it manually. Overall its not worth for rs.2500. I have come across another earpods which is very cheaper in price but I must say that gives more call clarity than this....🙃

Dont Buy ! Very cheap quality product. The touch buttons operate automatically. They do not always pair when you remove them from the case. Most of the times you have remove and re add the device in your bluetooth settings. I had raised warranty claim one month ago, but the company is not even replying to emails. Pathetic service !

- Chinese Manufactured Product- No return policy, only replacement option is available- Calls disconnect abruptly, even in full charge- Touch sensors are very sensitive at times and few times do not work even after multiple attempts- Voice on calls is not clear.

Not suitable for call,, Developers not tested it properly,Most stupid product,, Whenever you take call it falls you try adjusting it and call cuts.atleast 5 second touch should cut call, Irony is it takes 5 second touch to raise volume which should be single touch functionality.

Well at first I was a little sceptical about the product but since I have used almost all the wired and non wired products from Boult Audio and it's the only company where i have found my true taste for perfect bass and trebel the mid and lows are crystal clear and these Propods are the best I use them almost everytime and I love the charge it goes about 7 to 8 hours of continuous music and yt video playback and the case is well built i have dropped it a couple of time yet it's not even scratched if anyone who is willing for an upgrade i would suggest them these Propods and get yourself in the game of wireless earbuds.

My first pair of True wireless earphones, looks cool in black color and good for money value. I have never been too comfortable shifting to wireless earphones for the fear of losing them. For the value of money it has got features like auto connect on opening the case, though the touch controls are very sensitive and still getting used to them.Will be loved by those who are comfortable with low bass.Sound quality wise is pretty good and okay kind with noise cancellation.

One things for sure. This is not complete noise proof but it lets you just hear enough. Good build and good battery life and backup. Comfy to carry. it's like a daily use object and the music is clear. There aint those distorted or low quality disturbances. P.S I use a OnePlus 7T.

Sound clarity awesome and the bass is smooth & clear. Talking about treble is superb superb superb and of course looks are very sexy as compare apple airpods. Awesome device & it has a good sound quality. The build quality is also very good. Battery backup stays longer. The device comes with extra sets of earbuds making it my awesome purchase. The call quality is also good as it gives proper noise cancellation. In this price range it is going to give competiton to apple , boat and JBL. One more thing i would like to share with all my friends that it’s sound is crisp enough to give a feel of song you are playing. I am satisfy with this product.

Let me come to the point.The bass is good,The clarity is good, (i am not telling excellent)And built quality is average (although it has water resistance)Overall a good product for the money.. Go for it if you can't afford apple probuds.

This is an amazing must buy product. The build quality of the charging case and the ear buds itself is of top notch quality. It's very light and comfortable to wear. You hardly realise it's there. The fit is very snug so there's no faewr of it  falling off while jogging or working out. On top of it it's IPX5 rated so you can swaeet all you want and slash it with water too. A quality product from Boult.

I have loved the product.The only highlights are:1. Sound Quality is great but it needs to get a bit louder.2. Great for Comfort, Gyming, Cycling, or anything rush.3. Look: for looks, I will give 9.5/104. Battery Backup: I have used for 9 hrs till now and my case's battery is still having four lights on.Thanks for the great product Boult Company.Looking forward to have some more boult products...Regards,Abhishek

Charging holds good.Sleek designFits in my helmet while driving and doesn't pop out easily from earsBoth the plugs are master so, good to use with just one earDoesn't work well with laptop calls. I literally had to shout on the call.Bass isn't justified for the name AirBass.Overall  a good product given the price range. Bought it for 2k during Sale in Oct

Its my first tws earphone. I am happy with that , sound quality good in vocal and crispy . People who does not prefer more base definately go with it .Noise cancelling not much better because it comes with passive noise cancelling .More imressive in comfortable and snug fit we can use it for long period of time .Battery backup also good in this price segment .Its definitely value for money in 2k segment.but not fir calls .

Initially It's totally superb 💥💥💥... excellent to listening the music 🎶 with average bass control.  After 2 months usage , left side earpod is not working, the same time charger also not working properly.After removed the both pods from the charger and after fully charged the pods, the charger lights continuously glowing and battery power also going to down...  I am not expecting  and I was disappointed 😞😞😞

I went to buy this product after watching few reviews on YouTube, which bets on the product and they all sounded so confident about it.But the reality is, the left earbud stopped working in the first use itself. Terrible quality product. Do not go for it by seeing it’s looks.Lessons learned are, don’t trust YouTube Tech Channel reviews (I think most of them are payed to talk only good about the product). Also do not choose a product just because of it’s looks.

I've been using this propods for 6+ months. Had few issues here and there like Bluetooth not connecting or low sound. But it does work well. Gives great bass and is overall durable and worth the money. Fixed the issue of low voice when you keep the codec to SBC and if you put your earpods in the case and take it out again it fixes the connectivity issue too. Overall great product.

Ultimate TWS in this price segment.First impressions is Good. Battery life is awesome. Fitting in ear is best and passive noise cancellation is good too.Talking about sound quality , in 2.3K price range, you will not get better deal than this, using with equaliser , you will get super quality bass.Minor problem with touch sensor ... some times mistouch triggers Google assistant,  but you will be used to with that after some time.My verdictBattery life 4.5Fittings in ear 4.8Sound Quality 4.5Mic Calling quality 4.0Design 4.8Average 4.5/ 5.0

Not worthy!I don't like the bass and music quality.Mic doesn't work properly, I have to shout to talk to people on phone .No noise cancellation at all ( being a IPX5 water and sweat resistant it will work on its own if it's wet ! Then why it is water resistant .Plz don't buy at all there are many other which provide the best features.now I can't even return it !

Why not to buy (Zero star)1) Poor Build Quality. Pure low quality plastic.2) Poor Sound and bass quality. No noise cancellation as mentioned in product description.3) Poor and low range bluetooth connectivity. Generally gets disconnected while roaming with phone in pocket.Pros:1) Good battery life
"

I purchased the Boult Propods as they looked quite similar to the AirPods Pro. The matt finish on the black colour is very classy. The sound quality and battery life is also very good. The noise cancellation experience is also satisfactory at this price. Moreover, it is Made in India so guys go for it!

I used this product for 2 weeks. I felt overall it's good. The sound and everything is just fine. But the microphone isn't much capable to pick up our voice. We must speak very loudly but still the other side, voice will be very feeble. But if u are wearing a helmet, then it's so nice but then another problem arises. It pains when we wear this and a helmet together. But the product is still fine.

First point will talk about ordered and received on 12 oct 2021 and found that one earbud not at all working and damaged morover, there is no quality of sound. 2.I feel already unboxed and there is waraty card , accessories and damaged one received. Finally I have concluded that during offer time they are sending damged and return goods are sold.

As the description of this product says it's heavy. But I didn't find it heavy, it was light and easygoing. It connects really fast. As both Pods are Master Pods I am able to use One Single Pod at a time, and that's really cool. Has a decent sound quality. Bass is a little less but that's good for my ear. Good Noise Cancellation.Overall ThumbsUp to the Product. Really love the Boult Audio AirBass Propods. It's not for Calling Purposes outside, at Home the calls I made. Is Good.

Guys  buy this product because the bluetooth is  connecting well .HiSanjeev hereSo I wrote the complaint.  I am taking that back.  My Bluetooth Boult  audio propods is playing fine.

This pair of earphones is good considering the price it is sold at. The sound quality is good (note: in a noisy situation, you could hear surround noise)Bass is decent not too overpowered. The fit is great , doesn't hurt my ears , I'm able to wear it for 3 to 4 hours straight and I think that's definitely a big thing. They are super comfortable and lightweight. If you're looking for a good pair of earphones under budget , then these are surely one's to consider.

This is my first wireless earpods am soo excited while am receiving .After pairing  first thing I have checked is sound quality and is also superb 👌 .

These are actually good tws. Sound quality is very good for media consumption with both Windows Laptop and Android Mobile. Call quality using mobile phone is also very good. The reason why I am returning these is because of Zoom calls using laptop is big let down. Other parties won't be able to hear you.

The touch control on the buds is quite irritating. Everytime one needs to adjust them in the ear, the buds activate the voice command which is uncalled for.

I always had a great great experience with Boult in terms of sound in terms durability and battery backup , even in the very low priced products they have never compromised on sound and durability but not with this product sound is just average according to the price also battery backup and build quality is worse ..it hardly last for 2 and half hour and the build feels like it's not made by Boult .

Design is great with a reasonable pricing...Battery - 3 hour max which automatically turnsoff at 40 %.Sound Quality - Bass is not that punchy but can be boosted through equalizer ...Overall sounds good.Charging issue - sometimes it stops charging for left & right.Gaming - latency is too high dont go for it if you are a gamer ( pubg)Controls - Controls are very sensitive but your gonna be used to it while using it regularly & they are really good. Volume control is also given which is hardly provided by any TWS.Overall i loved it & im gonna rate it 4.0 out 5Over all i loved it in this price range

A good quality and a feature rich product at this price point. I have initially received a piece which didn’t work well with voip tools like skype, teams etc and got it replaced with another set, which works well for normal calls as well as voip calls. Battery life is also quite good, fits well into the ears with ease without any pain even for longer durations. The balance of touch sensitivity is something that needs to be improved, but you will get used to in a couple of days.

I have never seen such commendable service from a company before. I absolutely loved the product, but due to some reason after 4 months, the sensors were a bit off. I requested for a replacement or a return to be initiated. Even in this lockdown, as I could not send the product back to them, the team arranged for a pickup for the replacement. Such commitment is surely applaudable.

plz, don't waste money on this. The touch is too bad to be usable. These are the worst earphones. The first pair I bought got spoilt within a month. I claimed the 1-year warranty and got it repaired but even that had issues.  Thinking it was a manufacturing defect, I bought another pair for my brother, the same story repeats.

Good product to buy at this price range of 2500 INR and the features are awesome and they fit very snuggly without getting Itchen for using long time and are very lightweight. Good to buy. They won't even feel regret to buy. Just go for it.TIP: Long press on right propod for 5 sec to increase the volume and press similarly on left propod to decrease the volume.

At first I only plugged and felt sound was not up to the mark, just after a minute I used both the pods and felt the sound is good.The first song I heard was 1, 2, 3 (feat. Jason Derulo & De La Ghetto)Before purchasing I had a doubt on how they fit, will they fall if I run? But now I realise they won't fall.Will post again after long use

The spec sheet of this product is great. But the sound quality was so so bad. There was no loudness in the sound. Forget a thumping bass. There was no bass at all. The call quality was good indoors but in the traffic it struggled HEAVILY. My brother had bought Ptron Bassbuds which cost around ₹1000 and even they sound a lot better than these earbuds. I'm highly disappointed. Replaced it on the 1st day hoping I had gotten a defective piece, but returned it on the second. This was a waste of time for me. Disappointed and won't buy from this brand again.
"

Sound quality is good, comfortable to use, only problem is with mic. Person at other end complaints about low volume during the call. If mic can be improved then I don't think there is any other better earbuds available on Amazon in this segment. Price is also good.

Excellent built quality and good connectivity. However, I found it to be too sensitive on touch. If you are adjusting the ear pod, the call tends to disconnect. Hopefully I may get used to adjusting it quickly as this is too new a product for me. Overall a good buy.

Amazing build quality, calls are perfect if the environment isn't too noisy, and listening to songs, watching videos is a delight. Read the reviews, thought the bass won't be too profound, but to my surprise, it's very prominent but in no means overpowering. Use it for a lot of calls in office and listening to podcasts and songs while travelling, still had to charge it just once and still has some juice left after the fourth day.

Considering the brand ambassadors i thought i should take my chances with the brand of earpods.But the product build quality is cheap. The MRP shows 7999/- and i thought i got a good deal but after receiving the earpods you find they are literally cheap and is a bad Marketing gimmick giving huge discounts to lure customers.Average sound, bad microphone to much disturbance, while using the volume keeps changing automatically with a beep sound.

It was a great product with good bass and decent noise cancellation, until one day after just 4 months of very light usage the right earbud stopped working completely.

The product is excellent in terms of audio quality. There is likely no distortion audible to ears as well the bass is very good. The touch response is so fluent and to mention better than the TWS I've purchased earliar or after these. Just I would like to make them look bit of a more aesthetic. Also I loved the matte and gloss material combination of the headphone case.In this range they've been pretty good.

The sound quality is excellent , it is best for music and gaming but the mic is horrible.

I brought the product after a detailed check in the web, and as expected its better than I thought!

Allover earbuds are really nice only two things to point out.First is the touch sensor is really annoying.

I like the product. The sound quality is good ( not amazing) but they fit well in my ears. In the box you get another two pairs of ear tips which are useful. A usb-A to usb-C cable is also included in the box. Pairing is very simple. As soon as you open the box, they get connected to your mobile. Touch controls are good but they are super sensitive. There can be a lot of accidental touches which is a bit irritating. Overall a good product for the price but a little tweaking must be done to make it perfect.

Now the songs keep changing while I'm on the ride as the buds take even the moving air as a touch response, it doesn't get switched off even when I place it in the case and gets connected to my phone. Finally not worth the buy

Purchased the Boult Audio AirBass Propods during the ""Great Indian Festival"". They are extremely light in the ears and a comfortable fit. The sound signature is smooth and clear with textured bass. I prefer it over sound is muddied by excessive bass. The charging box is well built in matte finish. Only miss is that it does not support aptx. A decent purchase and recommended.

I'm writing this review after using it for one week.First of all the earbuds fit very perfectly in your ears which is very importantThe sound,bass and the call quality is very good. The sound from other side is clear..Cons:The main prob with this earpod is touch. On simple touch also the Google assistant gets activated and it's very much annoying. But if we get used to it then it's a very good earpod to use .
"

Earbuds are good does the job. Noise cancellation is also good i use the large buds. But it gets disconnected every now and then. Call quality is not good. And boult audio guys are annoying. They will keep calling you for cashback they will ask for your whatsapp number again and again so please don't buy this headphones if you don't want any harrasments. they will irritate you.

The right bud wasn't either working or charging, with only left bud working i felt that the sound quality is good and comfortable. Had ordered for the replacement on the day it delivered itself, after 2 time rescheduling the pickup by amazon / courier partner they collected it today and the pickup status still not updated.  Hoping for a good replacement

Just want to share my honest feedback that I bought this product recently, but had some doubt as being a new product introduced by Boult in market and not many reviews were available. However, after using it for a day or two, it’s proven to be an AMAZING product in this PRICE range of EarPods, Boult provides you good built quality and sound quality in this budget which kinda gives you value for money, I would recommend to go for it if you have low budget but you want a good product.
"

Nothing like i expected. I was like a cheap toy. As shown in picture it has to be Matt finished but got that glossy from outer skin. Controls are odd. The box was making a noise as there was in the case with was not fit properly. Overall it was a very bad experience, 2/5 from my side.

Excellent mid-range budget airpods.Pros:  Sound quality is at its best.  Ease of pairing (automatically pairs to the previously paired device without pain).  Better call quality  Extremely low latencyCons:  Pair multiple devices at once. (Though i dont think its a flaw, at this budget)

It's good if u have ur connected phone with you, it will get disconnected if ur 10-15 step away from ur phn, looks wise is good ...I buyed only to listen music n video call so that's fine with me....I should've buy different Bluetooth.

Pathetic productIt was working good in the start. Then suddenly stopped working.I did so many mails to the boult support but no response. So I had to throw this garbage away...I'll recommend to to buy any boult product as they have really bad customer service. Their moto is to loot you anyhow and once they got the money then it's ur risk..... No use of warranty..... Pathetic product... Pathetic customer service #boult

Don't waste your money at all. This is the worst product I bought. It has no voice clearity you can't listen anything. And the policy of Amazon to making fool their customer is commendable, when I purchase this they will offer me refund but after payment they refuse to refund. Don't ever shop from Amazon, worst shopping platform I have ever used.

I have bought multiple TWS devices and to me Boult propods is the best out of them.The one thing which I was looking in a TWS is better clarity rather on call or music which this device offers me.Moreover it has fast bluetooth connectivity and more connectivity range, which allow me to connect to the device in an instant and don't find any lag or disconnection if I move from one room to another room.
"
4484,"
I may be expecting slightly more than what I got. Sound Clarity is good. Very average Bass and Low Volume Level. The volume level is low and cannot be used only with one Pod in place. Read it has a dual master technology but I could not connect to two devices. Low call clarity when using with one Pod. Overall build quality is ok. Battery back up is good.
"

The left earbuds has stopped working, it is not charging properly and the connection also drops automatically. For few days I ignored. But later it stopped working. Boult call centre tricked me to delete my comments and give 5 stars and they will initiate the process for replacement and now after 20 days , they are not even responding to my mails.
"
4486,"
What I loved about these tws is the sound quality, they are not bass heavy which is perfectly fine with cuz bass can be adjusted. They have tuned the drivers for crisp sound quality. This is indeed the best sounding tws under 2000/- .. The build, i.e., the case is really flimsy and doesn't give me confidence that it is sturdy. But hey, sound quality is good and you can be careful about not dropping it anywhere.Cheers Boult Audio!

I liked the case quality only . But on the other hand touch control on buds is not working properly . It's buds do not connect with the charging pin in the case .

If you are looking for a perfect music companion with you, you must definitely try this. The sound quality is perfect. Also promises a good range of bass. According to me it is the best bud if you have something around 2000 (Not standard rate as I got this for 1799 in republic sale) rupees to spend. Promises a good noise cancellation. A kickass item. Fully satisfied.

The item got delivered with super fast speed within 24hrs.Coming to these Boult Propods they are excellent, with touch controls. The connectivity is immediate with no latency observed.

The mic quality is also good as the other people were able to hear me properly.

This is my first TWS and I am more than happy... Took some time to get acquainted with. But man these ProPods are so good. Nice and light, has touch controls for Play pause, previous next, volume up down, call receive... It got everything. Cute little case with Type C charging port. Goes well with my phone charger. Thanks Amazon for delivery in a week. Thanks Boult Audio for creating this nice propods... #livewirelessly

The product was  delivered in a day. Good sound quality and good call quality. Sometimes getting lag between the right ear and the left ear maybe that is because I'm still working my way through the controls. I had registered for warranty online and got a call from a representative on the same who also told me how to resolve the lag issue. Will update after using the product for some more days.

I got this 2 weeks back.. In first week everything is great.. But after that the volume gets low on its own.

The overall sound quality is really nice, the vocals are well balanced and treble sounds good too, bass is prominent enough, but not for bass heads, anyway the price point makes complaing stupid.

As it has latest Bluetooth version connectivity between my different devices like my mobiles and laptop is smooth.

This is a really nice product under 2k and I am really satisfied because it is worth the money I paid for this. The only factor is that it doesn't fits my ear but it depends person to person. Only thing I would like to mention is that the small size eartips cannot fit to anyone so if you have small ear, don't take this. Or else it's a superb product with connectivity and sound. Noise cancellation is not so good but u can answer calls with clear audio.

Charging issue. While removing cable from case after charging the charging pin came out attached to c-type cable and hence not able to charge.

Well designed but of not much use. Mic is awefull. The person on the other end can't hear clearly and sometimes there is a echo sound. I often end up repeating everything i say. Ok for media consumption . Sound is average but i guess that's good for the price. There is no bass.

Good one though for the price, my second TWS.. fits well, sounds are clear...case looks compact...touch is too sensitive..ear buds could have been better.

it worked good for a week. then i started having trouble. the lid of the charging box was loose. the right ear piece doesn't get charged automatically. need to open and close again and again in order to start charging the right ear piece. the sound quality is not that good either. very flat. and not much bass.

This is my first true wireless earbuds and i am very happy that I choosen boult audio airbass propodsSound quality at this price point is so much good than my expectationAlso the connectivityBattery life is also good I think as it not get discharged till now though i used it for 6-7 hours so I think it is as mentioned by boultFit is also goodI didn't feel any latency in the propodsOverall its a good deal at the price point of 2.4 k

I don't like this product . Even 1% is also not worthable for my money..the volume automatically down it self...beep sounds are coming contineously..what's is this non sense..the main purpose to buy ear buds for some peacefullness  .but it is irritating contineously when I connect..worst product

Average Product, Not satisfied at all..Sound level is too low. Ok to listen music in calm area like room etc..Not recommended if want to use for calling purpose...Very poor quality...Many times echoing. For call purpose even Earphones with Rachel 100/- is better than this...Not happy with this product.

The buds sound great, have clear and crisp audio reproduction. The buds are light weight.The problem is that the buds are a little bulky, so will not fit easily in the ear. The ears start aching after a short period of time.

Don't buy this product after using this for 2/3 months im facing problem in audio, and in speaker zero noice cancellation and the sound is too low im unable to listen the voice of the speaker while on tne call vise/ versa .....and i cant able to return it to the company because Amazon has only 15 days return policy

Feels comfortable mostly... Not for jogging or running. USBC charging is a benefit. Small form factor is easily pocketable. WorldAddition of Bluetooth 5.0 for multi device pairing would be good but overall, it's a good product
"
4574,"
Right out of the gate these earphones seem cheap. Feel like cheap plastic and absolutely not worth the money. The case cover is not firm and seemed like it would break easily. One of the earphones wouldn't even fit perfectly in the case. The bass is lackluster and noise isolation is non existent. The quality of sound is ok but not what I expected for ₹2000

4575,"
As of my usage of  1 week it looks and works good for me but dont belive in old youtubers as the specs have veen changed by company it gives about 24 hors of charging and the ligh comes only after you takeout and keep the earbuds and the ligh will be on for 5 minutes totaly a good produ

Sound quality is good under this price point.Noice cancellation works ok.We literally have to speak lound while talking on a phone call or else the earphones will catch outside noise more than ours this is the only con i am facing reviewing it after a month of usage.Battery life is awesome

Sound - good (bass), not averageI returned it as I can't use it for daily calls. Even when the product have 2 microphones still it doesn't provide better quality call experienc. Other side gets a very low voice and everytime I had to use volume enhancer to make calls.
"

I would say that for the price of 899 rs the Bluetooth earphones from a well-known brand is a steal of a deal,If anyone getting this headset below 1k, I would suggest you go for it because its a pro versionJust buy it .

I have been using this for 2 days and to behonest it is not that good at a price of 2.5kAnd even the bass is very low and touch is not responding... In comparison to boat airdopes it is not even 20% of them. But let me tell you mic , noise cancelation and sound quality is good and there is no issue in charging...i think it is not worth 2.5k but decent..

I disliked the sound quality bcuz it's my 2nd time replacing the same product and then also the Right Side Propod is not giving the same sound like the Left one......

The operation was slow as I used it with iPhone. It takes time when touched to receive call. The touch part is not fixed need to guess where to touch. There was case issue, sometimes if EarPods hasn’t kept properly the light was on and it didn’t get off automatically. Over all battery is good. Design is good.

I had bought these Boult Audio Airbass Propods a week ago and the quality is extremely good. I liked the bass production and the sound quality. Battery backup an standby time are good.

This is getting disgusting. In my first delivery the touch controls stopped working after 2 days , I replaced it , now the newer delivery has already the right bud not working plus the finishing of the case looked like refurbished....is this a joke?!

The Boult Audio Airbass Propods excels with its audio quality and battery life. Under Rs 3,000, these are easily one of the best picks for a truly wireless earphones. TWS exceeds in all parameters IPX rating, Design and Build, Comfort, Audio Quality and Connectivity and Battery life.I would say must go for everyone who their first TWS. Best and Bestest.!!!!

Returning this product due to only one bad thing. The call quality. Its really bad. Like the worst possible. The other person cant understand much when on call.

The build and audio quality is really good. The hing has a satisfying click to it. Charges fairly quickly.

Worst product ever. Below average call quality. Connection issues. Fake battery percentage. Low audio quality. It says noise cancellation but this thing is opposite ,it attracts all the surrounding soundPerfect fitting and great touch control but I didn't buy it to just put it in my ears and touch.

No cons except that the Mic quality is a bit off. During calls, the other person has trouble hearing me clearly and this happens for every call. It's ideal for listening to music, and watching movies. Noise cancelling is only passive, not active.Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase.

I bought it at risk there was less reviews at this item, but it was the right choice the sound quality was soo good, the time took to connect was so fast and quick, navigation guestures are soo good, buds was not perfectly sitting when we change the size but it can manage, fitting in ears are soo perfect it doesn't fall down while running also.

1) The quality of overall product is amazing. Though made out of plastic the buds as well as the case are nice and sturdy.2) The battery is up to the mark after an average usage i need to charge it once in two days.3) The buds fit comfortably into the ear canal(can differ from person to person).4) The sound quality is crisp and clear.5)For the given price the product is amazing.

Boult Audio Airbass Propods have a lot of features for a good  price like open the case and connect and each bud can be used separately. The sound is good but the bass is medium  and noice cancellation is ok. Highly recommended for people who want to explore true wireless earbuds.

If you are looking just for listening to wireless music or movie it's good . It's pathetic if you use for calls , the receiver would complian that they don't hear you well .Audio trasmission is not good during calls.Think before you buy to meet your purpose.

There is no Noise Cancellation , difficulty for calling, You people mentioned return/refund option, but when we go onto the option it is mentioned as only replacement, what a smart kind of froud you are doing with your customers, I thought if I get defective item, I can replace it, but if the issue is with every product of this model, then i need a refund of my amount, not replacment.

Overall the product is superb in this price range as not seen any other products with this feature  in this price range . Also it has passive  noise cancellation which I found very good .

I think it's a good product for a reasonable price, it work perfectly....More than impressed! :-0I didn't know what to expect from these Bluetooth earphones given I've had a checkered history with Bluetooth audio!

I have used this for almost a month now. It’s absolutely compatible with my iPhone, almost as good as the iPhone wired earphones. Only issue is it has a sensitive touch which maybe be a problem while on calls when adjusting the earpieces it could cause call disconnections. Highly recommended otherwise! Satisfied with the product overall 👍🏻
"

The product serves the price it comes at amazing audio and beautiful bass, it is hard to attend calls because the amount of noise it captures from the background is grand (outdoors) ... So if you wish to buy it for music and gyming and even gaming they are go to buy ..The built is good for the price.

It's one of the best products I've come across at this price and very promising. ir works as it is said plus after product services are very good and I am glad that I chose this product for my experience.

This product is quite good. Like I purchased it after seeing other products of its competition and it came out to be the best. Audio and treble is too clear. Bass is good... But not that great.

Ok , this is a pair with good sound but it has 0 absolutely 0 sturdiness, was finicky from the day I ordered , I started using it in Oct and it doesn't work anymore in November , didn't drop it once didn't harm it even once and it has stopped working , DO not buy this , if you don't want to loose your money .

Sound quality is acceptable… but after using for less than 4 months its starts to show some problems, mic is very poor, they are giving 1 year warranty, even before that the product shows some problems in paring and charging also the customer services was very poor eventhough i registered a complaint they are not giving any responds. Not recommend for buying!!!

Boult always been for best products in the market.Yes this Pro Pods also compete in the market with best SOUND and BASS quality.Coming to Noise Cancellation , yes it's trying its level best.

I'm not an audiophile but let me get this straight, these are my first TWS pods. Sound quality is amazing. You need to set the equalizer for good bass and treble. Noise cancellation is lacking a bit. Battery backup is good. Overall awesome product. Buy it you won't regret.

For the price point these are really impressive and i was a bit doubtful about the call quality, but it’s pretty good!

The battery life is pretty good and the connectivity is amazing aswell is IOS. It’s the first time I’m trying Boult and it’s an amazing experience with boult.

The instant wake pairing feature is awesome. Sound is also very crisp clear with decent amount of bass. After 10 days of usage I rate these earphones as follows,Connectivity:- 5/5Sound quality:- 5/5Call quality:- 4/5Build quality:- 4.5/5Gaming:- 2.5/5But the only con is low latency gaming feature doesn't seems to work at all.

This looks sleek and amazing. But the audio quality is bad and yes it comes with lot of features but they're not working and there support is too low to respond to your calls
"

Dont purchase boult product. once you claim for warranty you need to send product to company by your own money. even you need to send more than once. because boult is not  repair product genuinely.Send 4 emails to boult still not getting any response from boult.

A decent and must buy product for beginners who want to use TWS pods ❤️, touch gestures are totally fine except volume up down which needs to get habituated to it! Over all product is AMAZING in this price range! Open and close box for connect and disconnect is cool.
"

The sound quality is great but the Mic quality on call is literally worst, the person on call can't hear you clearly while on noisy area.While on room with no noise it would be fine but just go for different buds if you gonna use it for call or online meeting!
"

Worst product , after 10 days of use my touch buttons stopped working and for replacement or repair we have to mail them .Boult service is so bad that its been 1 week now and they didn't responded i have called several times to them they just make excuses ,i feel really sad i wasted my 2500 rupees in which i could buy a better product
"
4682,"
Sound and bass is good but what are the benefit if the pods itself doesn’t survive for long. Major issue is with pods itself they are not as shown and described, I’m facing right now charging issue with pods as the pins in the case not connects well with the connectors down the pods.
"

The headphones will not connect with any devices, and also it says boult freepods, instead of boult airbass proposal. Highly misleading and unexpected.Bluetooth won't connect with my phone and the return window is also closed, even though the seller had send a replacement it is still having the same issue.

Its my 1st time trying TWS at this price point it is the best.Im pretty much impressed about its connectivity and it's range.Noise cancellation is good,sound and bass quality are acceptable,fitting is perfect and I put it on like 3 hrs and I didn't get uncomfortable,touch sensors bring this one to nxt lvl.

The Propods are very nice with an awesome bass quality. I found the battery life preety good . For a person whous uses them for some music or casual meetings or classes should definitely use them. Nice product. They also provide the warranty for one year so you don't have any issue

Built quality is exceptional at this price point. It looks & feels premium. Connectivity is also great only issue i faced was with noise cancellation it lacks somewhere. Otherwise its a good product considering price of ₹2000

After using it for a couple of months, it feels that this a nice TWS at this price. It provides a very smooth and fast connectivity with Android. Very good battery life. Sounds really nice. But base is a not that great. And type C is again a premium feature.Overall this is a good product if you are looking for TWS.

The product quality is fine but after 2 months it start giving trouble. one piece stopped charging and another after some more weeks. its a waste as the warranty team ask you to courier it to them. so its useless for short & long term.

Worst earphone purchase ever. Off no use. Listening music is ok. Call experience is worst. Can't use at all as the person on the other side can only hear the side disturbance more than our voice.

I got returned product..... Thats make me feel bad.... Please provide a new product.. I got sep 11..

No. I was wrong.. Boult is such a stupid company i have ever used. They are irresponsible. I mailed them. But no reply yet. My earbuds are under warranty and it is not working properly.

Pros:-- great battery life- good sound quality- great customer supportCons:-- functions can be finicky as they are touch based- lack of info on which device the earphones are currently paired to. So you might think that they are not working.

Everything about it is bad. Calls get disconnected with even slight touch, even if it means taking them out of the case. One call will end up in 3-4 disconnection if you try to wear them while receiving a call. DONT BUY, even if its CHEAP.

These are the best wireless earplugs in the market right now with super amazing sound quality and noice cancellation and if you are looking for the perfect bass quality this is the product.

Honestly the best pick in this price range or even much better thn pricy ones.U will fall in love with how easy it works, u dont have to go through the same process everytime to connect thm, they connect automatically when you open the flap of propods case. Battrery life is just as amazing as anything else. In short if you're thinking of switching to complete wireless , just go for them.

For 2000 rupees, it is avery good product. I used it all night for listening to music while sleeping and when i woke up the battery was at 40%. Added to this, there's a charging case. Sound quality is great. Noise cancellation could be better but in minimal noise environments, it is very good.

The earpods sound is very clear. They're loud enough too. They connect instantly , by the time you take it out at put it in the ear it's already connected.The case I recieved was a bit Squeaky. Not a major concern but.I personally felt it lacks the good bass.

Have been using them for a couple of days, and the best thing about them is the sound balance...bass and treble are just perfect for me. Listening to calls, songs, videos is great.

If this point is rectified, this earphone would definitely be the best selling airpods in the market.

Very nice product l, worth the money no one can give this much specifications at this price.

It's pretty good. The mic works really nice. Usual propods have bad mic quality but I am satisfied with this one.It's a little on the pricey side. Haven't used it long enough to tell anything about the durability.

This a bad product. Doesn't always charge the buds while in box. You have to tap it like old tv to charge. Sometimes one of the buds don't work. In only half an hour to hour use ears start to hurt. Its a waste of money. I have stopped using it.

The pods aren’t successful for calls. You need to talk loudly so that the other person can hear you. The bass is not good and the touch fors not work as per your command. You want to change the song it’ll stop it And so forth.

To all the runners and exercise lovers, I would suggest this product.It's a perfect fit and doesn't fall off. Sound quality is something that's very good in it. When u take out all the odds, for a budget under 2.5k this is one of the best you could have.

good sound quality, deep bass but you'll have to use a volume booster to get good bass output. comfortable, snug fit, and a good buy at 2300. satisfied with the product. wake and pair feature works very well. no latency or lag issues. wouldn't recommend for calling use,as it's microphone doesn't pick up your voice well.

I used it for 10 days and then one earphone stopped working. I would like a refund as this product is an absolute waste of money. Even the sound quality is terrible and the microphone doesn't work well as no one can hear me when i attend calls on it.

A quick honest review.Wanted a portable earphones alternate to my big headphones which sometimes gives pain to ears after constant use so thought of getting earphones as having earphones and headphones at same time is like getting better from both the world's.Design - red variant have killer color design.Sound- very nice even at lowest volume, you can still hear it nicely.Bass- justify at this price range.Treble- just equivalent to bass magnitude.What I felt is that in this earphones bass and treble goes hand by hand , none of the one has edge over other which makes it perfect for me. Both are complimentary to each other, perfectly match.What I didn't liked is in ear design, it pains sometimes, comes with different sizes of ear buds and rings too so you have to see which one fits perfectly.Overall at this price range it's worth it, definitely go for it.Edit: it's 24 September 2020, more than a year and it's still delivering music without any issues. Moreover I have purchased many earphones in between ,some in ear and some headphones, but this is still working while many have encountered issues. I have used this while riding bike under heavy rain so it's also immune to rain, mic wasn't very good from the beginning as it should not be for a calling purpose. Music is really good, seeing its overall built quality and thick wires,it's pretty obvious that that's why it still working perfectly fine without any issues.

The company says that it has subwoofers! They do not perform even close to what subwoofers are supposed to do. I had to increase the 60 Hz Freq response by +10 Db using an EQ to get enough bass that will give a flat sounding experience. For this price point, I have seen different earphones that perform really well in the low frequency range. The mids and highs are okayish and are suitable for watching videos and movies.About the build quality and form factor, they are well built, 3.5mm jack is angled and will last long. These are durable earphones if you take care of them. And they also provide different sizes for ear support buds.

1. First  of all, be aware that item can only be replaced not returned.2. Coming to quality of the product:  Pros:  i. sound quality is ok  ii. range is ok.  iii. cost is ok.  Cons:  i. control buttons are difficult to be distinguished from each other. You will find difficulty in deciding  which button your fingers are touching.  ii. control button are not placed ergonomically. This is a very poor design. In a desirable design, If you  are wearing your earphones such that the control buttons are on the right hand side, then the right  hand thumb must be able to quickly reach to them.  But here, they are placed such that, that your right thumb lands straight to the  charging port. You intuitively feel it is a button, and then struggle there  for sometime because you think it is button but it is not !  Then you blind-search and get actual buttons. Worse again, among these buttons also, you struggle  to understand which- is- which, because they are so little projected above the main body.  iii. They will give you a replacement, not return the item. But, what will you do with that? So I have to  keep this.Overall, NOT RECOMMENDED.

Build quality is ok. Not braided.Sound quality is ok not good. Why ?Cuz Bass is high but at the same time tribble is high too.So for some HD songs , some sound will become sharp and it is gonna hurt in ears.People who are saying clearity is good. They actually like high tribble with high bass.Also sound is distorted at loud voulme.I feel it sounds like old days intex speaker which has high tribble and high bass at th same time.I am returning these.P.S - I am not strictly bass lover and I like overall sound quality.If you are bass lover go for boat. I ordered and returned boat 152 which has loud volume and high bass.I am using Mi dual driver earphone which is overall good.

Purchased after seeing review with suspicion that it may result in a stupid Chinese product, but review was right, product is marvelous in sound quality. As per cost which is meager in terms of quality. It is far better than Sony or other leading brands. I assure if purchased you will not regret and will feel the little magic sound to your heart. It has inbuilt tweeters and bass quality is superv. I wish i have made a sincere review.

Its Good Overall.I previously used Sennheiser CX180 ,skulls and Audiotechnica.Ordered Boult because I thought this is in my budget, got it for 450/- (you can get a better deal)Looks - looks super premium.Feel - it's bulky, long wires. Looks sturdy and should last. It's shipped with small eartips and other option is too bigger. I feel is not the very comfortable earphones to wear but it's not very bad. It has wings which holds it pretty much in place.Sound - sound wise its really something good, it feels it has good depth to it . It's not at all bass centric. Trust me you don't need heavy bass to dominate your music. I found it very good for psychedelic music it's does a good job but not the best and can't be compared to CX 180. Noise cancellation is best in class if you use smaller eartips. Again, lows mids and Highs are perfect , im not pro but I judge how well my techno music sounds.I guess I will like it more as I use it more and it gets through sound burn.Gaming - Really good for gaming , PUBG is good though again footsteps are very legible but there is room for improvement. Call quality is good.Verdict - Value for money. If budget permits go for Sennheiser.Yes this is made in china , I don't know how I feel about it. And it's 999/- on mrp so the deal I got is goodEdit : Right side ear bud stopped working after one month. Sigh. We can't even replace it after one month,I expected more from this buds.

I don't understand why this product has such good reviews. I bought it because of the ratings it has and its the worst. Why ? Because 1. Everything sounds extremely muddy. 2. Base is terrible. 3. It cannot handle lows at all. 4. I do some mobile gaming and this is terrible for that purpose as well because even the crisp sounds such as footsteps and gunfire (in cod mobile game) sounds really low and not crisp at all.Tl; dr. Don't buy. Especially if you've used JBL tier of earphones.

It comes in a no frills box, in fact a plain paper box, that you might pass off for a matchbox or a medimix soap box, if not for the labeling. There are other products out there which have elaborate packaging with all the glamour going with it , but are of very flimsy make and deservedly do not last more than a couple of months. Now these are about the build quality. I will update on the same review about how well it lasts the runs. I understand that earphones generally have to stick to strict size guidelines to stay in the market full of optics, and this one is no exception. So I am going to reinforce the joints that connect to the earbuds before I start using them.Ok I m back after using it for a week or so, and boom the wires are shorting and the volume is being dragged down randomly. So not built for purpose

This is a beast for Rs 400. For listening to songs onlyNothing I guess comes closer to beat this at such priceExcellent BASS, sound for songs etc is awesomeStability n comfort is great, and doesn't pain in ears even after using for 4-6hrs continuously.So the earphones won't fall off.Wish trebble was balanced. But these days all earphones seem to only care about BASS.If you are looking to use this for office calls due to wfh, will not suggest this then since the bass is high, many times you won't hear words clearly.Use something which is more of a sterio or hd or medium bass earphones then

Excellent product. Earlier I was using sinhisser C120 earphones but it's microphone stopped working. I was in search of product in a 500 rs range. I had also bought a realme 2 bud but it sounded like a 100 rs earphone. After going through many product review's I choose Boult earphone as it had a five star rating and all positive reviews. Its performance out performs all products in its price range. I wish it came with a carry pouch and magnetic earbuds.

I have been using this since I received the package. The price was high when I bought it, than it is now.Pros:-It looks good, very cool look.-Ergonomic design.-For the first few days, it worked good, balanced audio output.-Outstanding Bass[Bass lovers will love it].-Used during workout sessions without any problem.-Extra ear cushions of different sizes are given along with the earphone.-Unique angled 3.5mm jack for better connectivity, its not straight, or 'L' shaped but bent very nicely, hopefully it'll help it last longer.Cons:-After 10th day, right ear audio level dropped a bit. I have tested it on several phones and Mp3 players, the right earphone audio level has suddenly dropped a bit.-Not tangle free wires.-Warranty Card in the box is useless, it asks you to go to a specific url and enter your earphone details for warranty, but after you enter your details, the page doesn't acknowledges your warranty.Honestly, I didn't expect any better at this price range. Got what I paid for.

 I found this one is best headphones in this price range. Voice quality is also good. They provide aluminum body on the top. But, where the mic is, it is plastic, it is not aluminum moreover its 3.5mm jack is not completely L shaped. Otherwise there is no issue with the headphones in this price range and this is the best headphone in the category of budget headphones. There are also some useful specifications like gold plated 3.5mm jack, tangled free cable, sweet proof & light weight headphones.⭐ Sound Quality : 8/10⭐ Noise Cancellation : 7/10⭐ Bass Quality : 9/10⭐ Durability : 8/10

Overall the performance of this earphone is amazing . At the purchase time I think it's just an ordinary earphone just like other & price is higher but believe me I am wrong .I never expecte more but i shocked when I use it first time .Noise cancellation is amazing whis is unbelievable and bass quality is also good anough*At this price range believe me I never got any product as compare to this Bault AudioOne last suggestionDon't think more and just purchase it you gonna love this. And if you don't satisfy then you know what to do .But I am sure this earphone boost you music experience

Sound quality - 8/10I have used much higher priced earphones like around 1500-2000. So, my experience would be according. The sound quality is amazing. I mean I couldn't believe it would be relatable to those expensive earphones. However, note that the bass is not high but the mids and acoustics are perfect. So, to me this is absolutely worth that amount.Noise cancellation - 9/10Sometime double tunes but to this price it's foing an amazing job. I just love it.Bass quality -7/10The bass was not as expected coz the way these copy words are written it isn't upto the mark. But hold your jabs .I told that I have used ₹1500-2000  earphones and you can easily get that qualis. How? By just downloading bass booster app.Believe me, I downloaded 'bass booster' app the the sound quality was comparable to all those expensive earphones!.Comfort -8/10The fins which you see would be helpful only when you do some really good running or activities like that. If not if you use the fins while laying then it will hurt. But , if these fins are removed then you have the most comfortable ones.Nutshell - You can absolutely go ahead and buy them. I also have mi basics and jbl zip 20 . All the three are in the same range. So, the top is Boult and then mi then jbl.P.s - Bass lovers , download some bass booster app and you are cool to go.

I have been using boAt earphones since it's launch(have almost all the boAt products). Wanted to try out other brands so bought this earphone...I'm giving my review comparing with boAt basshead 225 earphones as both the products are in the same price range(+/- in few rupees).°Light weight.°Sound quality is fine! Trible is more than bass. Whereas in boAt basshead 225 treble and bass is equal. Can say the bass is more.So people who are looking for more bass, close your eyes and go for boAt basshead 225.°boAt has a tangle-free and flat wire and feels premium But in Boult it's round and quality feels a bit low.°Microphone has a slight distortion, I might have got a defect earphone. But I don't agree with that as I bought 2pairs at once and both the earphones have the same problem..°and mainly DOES NOT SUPPORT LAPTOP JACK!. so if you wanna use earphones for a laptop or desktop, don't buy this...Overall I can say Boult Audio x1 is a good earphone for people who doesn't like more of bass... but not good for calling.

I hate to admit that I used to be a fan of this brand. But the products have become cheaper in quality now. The mic and sound balance was lost in a month.No service centers around. Have to courier to Delhi.. It costs me 91 rupees. I did it twice.By the way, the earphones cost is 350. So if I get to and it twice again, I would've got a brand new set instead.Boat earphones in same category looks cheaper in build, but they are actually durable. But these boult guys have all good things except durability.

1) Design is not user friendly2) Difficult to find buttons for on/off while around neck3) Only bass played but voices dimmed and low4) High price5) You are getting rubber tube in the name of flexibility and durability6) Length is also short around neck. Even my friends are complaining this7)Ear buds gets stuck inside after removing earphones. What's this??In All, this are imported third class quality material and assembled it in india and selling it with brand name with huge priceDisgusting 👊👊👊Earlier I used Sencer & U&I brand and they were really good... only thing is that sencer is very costly but this time I felt that Boult is cheating with customers

I had brought these earphones and they are very good for the price they offer. Only thing I was not happy is that earphones plug come out from phone automatically so I have to re-insert frequently. Otherwise sound quality is very good at this price. Good one to go if you are looking for decent earphones in lesser price.Based on customer support call which I got saying if review is provided they would give some reward. I had got a call and also whatsapp chat to provide screenshot of review. Once I provided the screenshot of review, they don't respond to me. They are not replying back hence giving less rating as I feel they are cheating customers.

1. Low Quality material used inside like jack, mic, rubbers, metal, wire and other.2.Yes you will enjoy at starting but not for very long like new things gives you joy just like that.3. I care everything I have, earphone too, I make sure no harm to this but but stop working after 3 moths, only wokin in my PC, now if you don't know, if you use earphone or headphone in phone and pc and other frequently than that jack of 3.5 has to be very good quality or else the strips in jack will get hampered and stop working, same happened.4. For some it may not be comfortable, because it's too small so especially big ears don't buy and important thing please don't fall for fake comments5.

These headphones are really good for the price, the lack bass and you could go for headphones by ""boat"" as they have the same audio sound but boat has more bass in the sound, these headphones but sadly they stopped working after 2 months, it's a good thing they're really cheap. The connector is not a right angle connector, it's more of like a 45 degree angle and bcuz of that keeping the phone on top of your chest as you're laying down is not comfortable as the cable digs into your chest, bcuz it's not a right angle connector the first thing to stop working entirely was the microphone, these are a good pair of headphones but the cables are just to fragile and don't feel like they cam hold up to even careful use, the only reason the lasted 2 months was bcuz I used them carefully, I used the to sleep and listen to music to. Just don't stuff these headphones on your pocket like other ones, it will get damaged. And it's not a product work your time as it dosent even least that long for a pair of cheap earphones, I've bought a pair of boat earphones after this at the same prive and they feel and sound way better than these ones, the only advantage these headphones is the ear hook it has so that the headphones stay in your ear

Note to everyone who are planning to buy BOULT earphones:Items shown in picture are different than what is received in actual. I tried 3 models of BOULT brand and all has same flaws.1. Microphone placement is different. In actual it is placed at center where L and R wires split. However product images show microphone placed near mouth at either L or R wire.2. EP jack design is completely different than shown in image.

After few months-The build quality is good. For sound quality, the highs are clear and the Mids are good as well. The lows (bass) however, are only okay. It's does not have good enough dept or punchiness, unless an external equalizer is used with bass setting to max. Not recommended for bassheads,fine for watching movies and videos but not good for listening to music. Also not recommended to used while in motion, meaning if you are listening to music and walking, running or exercising, it causes the app to skip songs randomly before the current songs finishes. Only happens when using this earphone, as I checked with others as well.

As the title says, I bought it when I was desperately in need of a pair of earphones, no matter how much they sucked. Initial impressions of these weren't *terrible*, but they were really sibilant and hissy. They were awful to listen to at any volume. Now, I wasn't gonna be picky about them because well: they worked.Here comes the sad part. Around 3 months into the pain-fest that these provided me, the already sub-par microphone on these stopped working as well as it used to. Within another week or so, they completely died and in calls, the other party literally cannot hear me.If you want my honest opinion, save up a bit more money and get something decent. Avoid Boult Audio like the plague.

Considering its price, the product has good quality wires,sound and finish.ut definitely competes against headsets priced thrice it's costThe only con being a lack of aftersales support.Mine stopped working after 5 months.Since the product had stated a warranty of one year,I contacted the manufacturer through email and apart from an auto generated reply stating the complaint reference number,there has been no response whatsoever from the Company's side. Can't confirm whether the product has durability issues or is  just a one off case.

Okay so I really had to think a lot before buying these buds......and I gradually thought that what can I get in just 389? And really, I was blown right away when the product reached me. It's not that good though, but it's not worse too. I've seen many buds that claim to be good at the same price....or sometimes maybe above the price. But these are just dang good!Yeah it's right that the company had to make some sacrifice to make a good-sounding product like this, so I just want to share what I liked about the Boult Audio X1-1. First of all, the price. I mean 389 is high though, but if you want a good product which can stand strong and sound like bang on, this is really a great choice. The sound is absolutely great, the base is so high you can actually feel the buds vibrating a bit due to the bass. And it is actually more good if you have a dts or dolby digital or atmos subscription, it really gives more clarity and bass depth.2. The all metal construction with a gold plated headphone jack is such a A+ thing to see in this price. I mean, there are a lot of buds that do have metal body, but are not durable at all. But this one is an A+ construction.3. The noise cancellation, is really good. You can actually feel that cancellation happening. Although you need to note that if you opt for the small eartip, it might vary but the large eartip does more of a good job than the smaller one.4. The wire is matt like rubber which is honestly a sturdy option for such a budget. I mean, yeah a kevlar or cloth type wire would make a difference in durability, but still it actually feels durable in hand and I think it can bear with my day to day rough usage......I will probably update what's the condition, so might be helpful for some.5. The original packaging is very good and actually does a good job of protecting the buds.Obviously, I can't just keep on talking about all the goodies.....there are some minus points, some of which are terrible things to have in this earbuds. Let me just talk about those things too-1. First of all, what is this connector? It is not a right angled(90⁰) connector, it's like...umm.....a little bit more than 90⁰, it is like 105⁰ connector or something. Which makes it uncomfortable. Specially if you try to keep it inside your pocket, you might have to adjust the connector to actually fit your device in. Personally, I am not a huge fan of this design.2. The free ear holder rings are somewhat ok. I mean they do the job pretty good, but it is not of the correct size. The large one' s are not large enough and the small one's are actually medium one's.....which is quite confusing. But it's just a very minor thing. Much minor than the connector3. The sound is no doubt a bang, but when you are listening to a bass+high pitched song, it tends to lower the vocals and tries to boost the bass a lot. At first, I thought it was my phone that was doing this, but no it's the earbuds. This won't affect a lot of your music hearing and I think some might not even notice this.....not at all. But as a regular user of buds, I feel they could have tuned the drivers to be a little aggresive in high pitched songs4. Altough I said that the wire is good. But need to mention, it's rubber, and it will break someday. So not a good choice too.But overall I liked it alot. It might be because of the price, might be.....but still for average person, gamers, it will be just an awesome budget buds. And if I had to score the buds according to each of it's section, here they are:-Sound quality 9/10Sound volume 10/10Bass 10/10Treble 10/10Design 100/10(I really lyk it :-) )In ear experience 8/10Ear rings 7/10Ear tips 8/10And that's it, if you found this review helpful pls do vote(might make me popular :-P )

it has 3.5mm gold plated jack as usual but its port is neither straight nor 'L' shaped its somewhere is between forming somewhat a curve. It has dual color rubber sheet which is not great but quite sturdy . is mic and control button is in between of two wires, which I am not a great fan of I like it on the right side wire because if the mic is on right wire its much closure to the mouth but in this case its a bit far away. earbuds are not too much comfortable  it does not fit in the ear nicely and also the actual part that goes in-ear is heavy and also I think that they should have magnets so that they stick together when not in use sound is good obviously I can't upload an audio clip overall its good  if you can find something better within this price range go for that

After a month of use and a trip to the service center I must say it has one of the best after sales service. Now things that need to be improved.1. A dedicated app support for all the audiophiles (Come on!)2. Really one of the worst microphone.(Asking too much here already in this price point so please improve the microphone)3. Quality control required (The unit I got and the one I ended up with after the service request has a difference of night and day)After all that I'd still recommend it if you just want some good quality earphones for listening music if you think it's not upto your liking you can always make a service request. Worked for me.

This is a real set of budget earphones. Just choose the appropriate size of earbuds to comfortably pack your ears (do not allow the earphones go deep into the earcanal) and use the smallest size of fin, which suits most of the people (if it is bigger it pains you after using continuously for long time) and burn the earphones for just two hours playing various genre of music including bass heavy  songs. Believe me, the earphones give exceptional performance. I am a bass music lover. I can say these earphones produce rich quality bass. The phone calls are very clear both for the maker and receiver.  The reception of the mic is very good. Regarding noise cancellation, the performance is just acceptable. Finally,  the earphones are surprisingly priced at under Rs.400/-. Nowhere the specifications of the earphones are mentioned by the manufacturer, probably to avoid competition among their own products.

I don't know if it's one of the dumbest or the finest earphones jack design... For some reason the jack male pin came with the earphones ejects itself when it was connected to the smartphone (OnePlus 5T) and doesn't fit properly... It's so tiring and annoying to use the earphones especially with smartphones... Otherwise its functions are normal and works fine with other devices like laptop, ipod etc. However it doesn't deliver the quality of the sound & bass expected from the 10mm earpiece drivers, we can get much better quality sound n bass at around INR500 with other brand earphones with 10mm drivers... I would rate it overall 5/10 considering design flaw, cost and function. Good value for money product under INR 400.

I'm a moderate user and I've used Jbl Csi 100, 150 and 200 and the sennheiser cx 180 over the last few years. Was using jbl Csi 200 before they went bust after 13 months of use.Price : got it for 329 rs. Can't get a better dealOverall - 9/10Base - 7/10Treble 8. 5/10Noise cancellation 9/10Price 10/10And I'm going to briefly compare the above on the followingPacking - a simple box. No frills. Has diff sizes buds and ear support buds. Which is a bonus. No warranty card though.Cable quality and longevity - all of my jbl headphones have worked around 13-15 months max, with the exception of the jbl 150 csi going for around 18 months. The sennheiser(thinnest wires though) lasted me 2.5 years though. Can't say about these, but the cable quality is better than all the above branded headphones. Lets see how long they last.Sound - well well! Didn't expect this coming from Boult and at this price but the sound quality is great . Good bass(not too high, balanced) , treble and noise cancellation. Handle high volumes really well as well.For the price, I'd say its exceptional. Its better than the jbl Csi series and  considering you almost double the money. Though can't beat the Sennhieser cx 180 street. Its is the best in this segment in terms of sound but the major downside with the. Cx 180 is no mic. Which is why I gave it a pass.The only con I would say is the headphones are somewhat thick and will cause discomfort while lying down on the side and watching movies or listening to music.Summary - good base, sound quality and noise cancellation along with the best price. Comfortable while working out and don't fall off. Can't ask for more. Go for it.

I want to say product is good but not best. Bass quality is soo poor. This earphones is suitable for vocal based music. If you are looking for deep humming sound making earphones this is not the one. Go for other ear phones like Ant audio approximately same price range but this earphones sound is crystal clear and not so loud it's good for normal users. Noise cancelation is good at the price point. It fits perfectly on ears with provided attachments. Cable length also reasonable. I recommend this product.

I ordered this alongside with the new Realme Buds 2 . I was planning to give this to my father and keep the pricier realme one's for myself but boy I was wrong.....∆ These earphones produce more bass than Realme buds and even fit better 😂∆ The built quality is no where near Realme buds but that is to be expected as they cost almost twice as this one, The quality isn't bad it's actually decent for it's price👍∆ Sound quality and clearity isn't mind blowing, whatever it lacks in sound quality the Bass makes up for it🔥∆ In my opinion the bass is way better than Realme one's , they sound flat compared to this one. The Bass quality is surprisingly good , I didn't had too much expectations in the first place but they sound amazing. I listen to trap, bass heavy music and they get the job done you won't feel like you're missing something or it lacks something...Trust me I have used pleanty of headphones and earphones from almost all  the major brands and they have Sony level bass quality at dirt cheap price💲🔥I am huge fan of sony but I wanted to try something new instead but I wasn't disappointed going with these👍🔥🔥

Wired earphones is like daily driver for me. I am using them since Many years, but nothing last with me more than a year. No matter expensive or cheap in price, mostly I lose voice in one of the headphone.Now about this pair of earphone.Surpringly decent quality product at this price. Good built and decent sound quality and best part they are very comfortable on ear. Snug fitting and decent 10 mm driversPros :1. Good built and good wired earphones2.tangle free cable3. Loud speakers4. 1 button control , no hazzle5. Comfortable ear muggs with sharkfin support make them snuggled6. Decent bass and good midsCons:1.No magnetic connect2. It's not L shape connector but better than normal pin connector but takes more space than L shape which sometime trouble while holding mobile or laptop from sides.3. Control button material is not that robust, edges are sharp and unfinished which make them feel very cheap quality look.Overall it's a good buy for below 300/- catagory .Worth a try !!

After almost a year of using these earphones, here are my final thoughts in brief:• Sound QualityBass (7/10) - The bass is pretty okay for the price. Not too punchy, but definitely not muddy either.Mids (7/10) - The mids are clean and vocals sound really beautiful in these. Far better than boAt's bassheads.Treble (8.5/10) - Higher frequencies sound exceptional in these. Earphones twice or thrice the price of these don't perform this well.• Noise cancellationPretty average. It all depends on the perfect set of eartips that you put on and fit in your ears that can give you the best passive noise isolation.• Build QualityThe outer housing of these earbuds are made of aluminium and is very durable. The cable is thick and can take some damage. However, the mic stopped working after 11 months of use.• Final thoughtsDo I recommend them? Yes!! I'm someone whose very picky about the tech that I buy and these are one of the best earphones I've bought in this price range.

Fraud Warranty Claim of 1 year as in case there is some problem you need to courier it to Delhi/Mumbai at your own cost which may cost you more than the product's price. So better to buy Xiaomi or Realme earphones - with better quality, sound experience, calling experience, and availability of service centers all around you in your city.Undoubtedly built quality is good but what you will do with the built quality if the earphones don't works for basic functions. Mic stopped working within 1 month of use. Mic has a problem and the person on the other side never receives your voice properly.

Specs do help it in producing decent music and call quality. But here are some facts no one will talk about:- Check the point where wire comes out from the earbuds. The sleeving in actual pictures (see pictures posted by buyers) and product images are different. The sleeving on actual product simply looks 'cheap'.- Talking about cheapness, there is more. The quality of USB C port is pretty bad. OnePlus Wirless Z and Oppo Enco M31 have very good quality USB C ports.- The supplied charging cable is cheap too. It requires a good deal of force to insert and remove it. My phone's charging cable worked fine here.

Not good for calls OR online meetings.Too much noise is being picked up, sometimes either constant OR sometimes intermittent - but very sharp noises - that causes irritation of person on the other side.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Also, quite uncomfortable to use, after 40 minutes or so pain starts in ears.Tried both with angled clip & without it.Same results. Seems either some design flaw OR manufacturing defect - not sure if every other customer also facing the same.

I got a damaged packaging for my Headphones. Basically the product package was opened and its Seal was broken and then put back in place with tape. Stop cheating people by selling them used/second hand products. What concerning is that Appario Retail Private Ltd did this, which is the only one of many sellers that I trust on Amazon. I would really like Appario Retail Private Ltd to prevent this.Coming to ProductHeadphone's Build Quality is good, but sound quality not so much. Its just ok for the given price but you can get better for such price too.Sound Quality : 2/5Bass Quality: 2/5Build Quality: 5/5Noise Cancellation: 0/5 (Mic didn't work as they cheated by delivering used and defective product)

I can say this is not waste of money you can rely on it.Pros:#1 Good treble.#2 Decent bass.#3 Gold plated 3.5 mm jack.#4 Slightly tilted connector from the jack which is good not L shape but it is good.#5 Nice design for the ear hook it has a space so that it should not be lost. (Here it is better than BOAT BASSHEADS 225)Cons:#1 The ear hook will hurt you in long time of usage.( Because of that I use only one ear hook which is of other earphone (BOAT BASSHEAD 225), they are softer so I use them.)#2 Bass is decent not that great.#3 Cable quality is not that great but it's fine.

The product packaging was shabby and damaged...so much that dust had entered inside and the grooves of the earpieces had dust accumulated in them. The sound quality is acceptable for the price range however.....the mic is absolutely trashy!! The mic has terrible headache inducing disturbance and that's the reason I wanted to return this product right away!!! Unfortunately.....there is no refund option so I had to opt for a replacement. I don't know how the replacement product quality will be. Will update the review once the replacement is delivered.The mic of the replaced earphones is just as trashy. Absolutely of no use! Boult....stop scamming people by selling earphones with non-functioning mics as earphones with mic!Update: I got a refund as the replacement  earphones' mic was defective as well! Appreciate Amazon's speedy refund process.

Perfect earphone under 300 rs.Great sound and bass quality from Boult X1. The quality of the earphone is premium. Nice silicone earcups, silicone fins, and tanglefree wire, everything seems top notch. Boult always known for providing top quality under reasonable pricing, and this is no exception.This is my first Boult wired earphones ordered from Amazon. I had purchased 4 wireless earphones and headphones from Boult spanning 2 years for myself, friends and family.This is the lowest priced Boult Audio product in India, but it seems premium anyways.Everything is just perfect, but bad packaging and seemingly tempered seal are mood spoiler. The moment I see, I wanted to return the product, but I thought I must see inside and give it a try. The product inside seems safe and scratchfree.  So I decided not to return it. But I must say the packaging(or no packaging) is so poor and  didn't even deserve a single star rating, but 0 rating option wasn't available there. I wasn't expecting carrying case for This amount but I was expecting a decent packaging though.Not even plastic pouch to make earphones scratch free. This is pathetic.  Luckily earphone  survived all this because of good product material used.Please Amaozn India and Boult Audio IndiaTake a note of this, because this type of packaging and seemingly tampering issues gonna hamper your reputation in the market

I have used cheap earphone of 100-200₹ also and costlier one 1500-2000₹ as well. As per my experience this is rhe best buy I ever had considering its price.Build quality is nice, certainly gives a premium feel.Sound quality and mic quality is amazing (using it on daily basis for Skype call).A must buy product if you are looking earphones at this price point

I purchased this in May 21 from Amazon.I would like to start with the positives but there isn’t anything I can think of.Cons -Does not fit comfortably in the earsSound quality very averageBass - nothing muchIts been 6 months and already the right ear bud has gone off. I got this for my mother and she uses her things carefully, so was surprised to see this go bad so quickly. The last earphone from evidson lasted us about 3-4 years with good sound.I will be taking this up with Boult customer care. Hopefully they can resolve this.Note 2. - As of now both earphones have stopped working within 6 months of purchase. The warranty people said that I should send it to their service center to get it repaired by courier. Guess what they have only one service center in all of India, in Delhi. This is a company interested in sale of cheap products with no intent of customer service.Do you self a favor and buy Evidson. It worked 4 years beautifully with good sound and quality. Much better than Boult.

The sound quality is what u should expect from not so premium product. It lacks the crip that cannot differentiate between coherent bg music. Noice calcellation is mideocre, don't expect to cancle out the sound from traffic area.Build is good but also the placement of microphone differs from image. It's between connector of 2 wires in product.The reason for 2 stars and not 3 is that it came on sale right after I bought it and Amazon costumer service say they ""can't do anything about it"".I.e. can't compansate,can't return.I might tell Amazon as well,""*products are not stocks that they rise and fall every other day*""Cheers.i hope you enjoy the earphone.Edit - after using it for a while, bass is good mids is moderate but trebble and lows r terrible.  Now,i didnt bought these pieces to listen music but u can clearly feel the buzzing pitchy noise. Cheap sound quality.

Ordered in August, worked well for three months. Now one side has stopped working. To avail warranty you need to send the product on your own expenses.Invest ₹50 more and buy Boat Bassheads 100 they are for 349 or sometimes less on sale. My last pair of boat Bassheads lasted around 2 years.Updated on review (earlier gave 2 stars) : I sent the defected product to them to avail warranty, it was received by them on 20 December, as per their site they take 24-48 hrs to do the repairs and send the product back in that time frame and then it takes around a week to reach you ok fine with that.  BUT after an email on 22 December that I'll be contacted once the product has been shipped I haven't received any other update I've written to then numerous times but they are not replying, tried calling but no one picks up the calls. All in all not only they sell cheap products but then they also fool you in the name of warranty Claim and make you spend money on sending the products back and then you never hear back from them.

I have seen the quality of Boult Earphone has gone down tremendously....The Earphone they used to ship in the month of JAN,FEB, MARCH of 2020 and now what is available in August , Sept 2020 shows tremendous difference in quality. Now the latest products which are ship by company has poor quality of cable , Mike and noise cancellation is way poor now, The quality of sound is degraded …They are trying to save money by making so call cost effective poor products but they will lose customers very soon ..Perhaps this quality of product they might have specially made for India which is very unfortunate.

very poor. worst. after 10days, getting an extra sterio sound from right ear bud which is so irritated. every time i used to switched off the headset and reconnect it. some times its not been solved, later it been clear. return policy ended . so waiting for some days..Review after 1 month use:- battery backup is very poor. fluctuating the battery charge level indication.... some times its not getting turn ON even non used for 4hr, have to charge again. regular users... don't use it. waste of money. May be it was a duplicate copy, otherwise it was a refurbished one.still there is an irritable sound from right ear bud.( according to my one month using experience- it seems to be hearing extra stereo sound while shaking or touching the headset ).Amazon should take care of these type of products,else this will spoil the trust on Amazon.

At first it worked fine for a week but now, after a month it is having problems just like a Rs. 80 earphone. I mean it's wire where the jack connects to the Phone is having issues and loss of audio most of the time.For a 10mm driver earphone it is loud but it's not bass it's just noise. Unlike boat earphones like the once I have of 499 which I purchased 2 years ago and is still working perfectly this one is trash compared to it.Bass and treble are just noise and nothing else. As sson as you go above 80% volume of any video you will feel the piercing pain of sharp noise in your ears. Trust me just buy a boat earphone it's much better than this.

There is no doubt this is the best ep you can get for this price. But after 7 months one side of ep stopped working. For initial few moments sounds come then gradually goes off in one side. Tested on my ipad, mobile. Another one purchased by my brother which also lasts exactly 7 months. In his case one side of the ep completely stoped working. Unlike me, where I can hear the sound for few moments.

I have been using different companies earphones for more than 10 years now from bose, senheiser, boat, MI, Samsung, Phillips, Nokia, Sony, realme, skullcandy, moto, and many more. This time I thought to buy Boult as they are spending so much in their promotions. So I purchased just the entry level earphone for attending office meetings in this work from home environment. Audio quality is no doubt very good, but the mic is terrible. If I keep the mic even 5 to 6 cm away from mouth the recipient is not able to hear anything or a muffled voice. The same is the issue while normal calls. If you keep the mic just besides your mouth then it works good but just a few inches and it doesnot work.Also if you watching a 2-3 hr movie, it is so hard that the ears starts paining. So you have to take it out for a few mins after every few hours.Not recommend to anyone.

Once you buy it people are gonna.swarm you with texts and calls to ask you to give a good review and give stars. They would lure you with a 100 rupees reward. But you are not going to receive any. Atleast I didn't. The moment I dropped my review, they stopped responding to my texts. So I am going to give you an honest review. Other reviews might have been affected by the 100 rupees ruse. So don't believe all the five stars.I would have liked a longer cord, there's really nothing special about the cord. Mine especially had a pin point where the coating was eroded and you could see the aluminium. You get a gold plated L jack which looks cool and is practical. You don't get magnetic buds if that's what you thought when you looked at the metallic finish. That's definitely a con on my book. There are no volume control buttons. The buds are comfortable and and have a decent sound quality FOR ITS PRICE. You get passive noise cancellation, which experienced headphone users know is malarkey for product advertisement. It in the ear so yeah it reduces the amplitude of the surrounding noise. The thing I found really disturbing is, I don't know if it happens with everyone or if it's just me. But when I connected it to my tablet, I noticed it during a zoom meeting that even if my mic is muted, the headset mic continues to look for the surrounding sound. When you scratch against the smart button, you notice you can hear the screeching sound. I looked, but there's no settings to disable and enable mic. So it just keeps on operating even when you're not using it. Other than it's a decent product in this price range. Overall I would say that you either expand your price range or take this slightly above average product. It's not bad, but there's really nothing that sets it apart. I would suggest you to buy this product only if you're okay with it stop working in a short while or you're not looking for something permanent.

Okay guys here's what you wanna know...Does it provide a good surround?i. Yes, totally doableDoes it gives a nice bass?ii. It will surprise you, trust me you are not compromising much surfing in low to high.Noise cancellation??iii. It's an in-ear wired earphone, you can look for a headphone if you really care about that. However it could go loud to the extent that you may almost taste the buzz in your ears. That's good, right!Durability?iv. The wires good, comes with a couple of spare sets of ear buds and sure looks durable to me.. I've been using it for few months now and haven't faced any problems, not even had to untie it :-pTo sum up,, it's a good enough earphone. CHEAP (sure looks luxurious) the only thing missing is the buttons (vol up/down) but hey, 350 buck.. c'mon!

Got it for less than 400 rupees, sound quality is great in its price range, better than many competitors. Cables are good, thick and look to be rugged enough to last fairly long. Mic is okay for general conversations but no noise cancellation, and no volume controls on earphones (only call answer button is there) - but no regrets... asking for noise cancellation in this price bracket is not fair, one need to spend more for more features.Go for it without a second thought.

An avid lover of music and a stickler when it comes to headphones, I can't begin to describe the joy of listening to music with these headphones. Since the demise of my Sennheiser cx275 (which I used for more than three years), been searching for quality earphones for atleast 6 months when I stumbled upon this. Ordered looking at the price and a quick glance of the reviews for a friend who attends online classes, this is probably one of the best products I've bought on amazon (yes I opened it, though it was a gift, to check the quality!! - how can I let a pair of headphones pass through my hands without listening to it once??). Honestly I don't even feel like giving these away after hearing it. Nevertheless I will definitely buy a set for myself. Absolutely elated and spellbound at the quality, definitely worth every penny of the price.1. Good quality and balanced sound (play with the Equalizer and you can make it sound better!!)2. Superb noise cancellation3. Crystal clear callsThe only drawback (which I shouldn't even have considering the price) is that it is SLIGHTLY bulky and the fit, a tiny bit, uncomfortable. The quality definitely makes up for these drawbacks.

It may be good to just listen but after testing in my home office which is too quite i can sayMIC is too bad. You have to hold it in front of your mouth otherwise sound is too low. I think if i have to hold mic all the time then why not holding phone??I purchased this for call not at all fulfil my purpose.If in a quite room MIC performance is that bad then what happen if will go outside or gym??

 I Definitely Recommended this Earphones. Because in this price range of 299 /- is Worth it. And Very clear and crispy sound, Bass is Good but Not compare with premium ( On my opinion this is up to Premium Quality)Here It is some Pro's & Con's what i feel and discovered.Con's :-  • The Important is After Usasge of Long time i Got little bit of pain on my ears due the buds are not softy, it hurt ears on long time use.( May be i having sensitivity on ear )  • Treble is some high ( Adjust Equilizers on Player it's Very fine & i was get good audio experience) that's it.Pro's :-  • It's Durable (pictures taken on 22/08/22)  • Taggle Free, Dust free.  • I dont know this is water proof or not but this was Survived on heavy rain. But i struggled little for water out 😁😁.  • Sound Quality is Very Good., After Equilize it's Pretty Good.  • About Bass i told you above. It's also Good.  • Calls Voice is Good there was No issues  • L shaped 3.5 mm jack is Good make for Durability.  That's it Guys., I hope it's Helpful 🙂🙂  Thank you.

This was a cracking product from Boult. I had an old pair that i loved which i have misplaced. So i ordered one more. The nee ones have thinner wires and plastic earphone capsules.The earlier versions had premium thick wires and metal earphone capsules. That added to their quality, premium feel and audio quality.The present version is okish. Does not compare to the earlier versions at all.Move in the wrong direction by Boult.

When I received the earphone the mic was not working. How since the tenure for replacement was over I connected with the BoultAudio support. However, I was informed that I need to courier the respective earphone to their service center, to which I complied. I got the product back and this time the earphone was not even connecting to the phone. I tried connecting the same to other mobiles yet it did not connect to any of them. I raised a complaint again and yet again they want me to courier it with no confirmation that next time again I will not face similar issues or a new issue. This is highly unprofessional of any company.

Excellent for the price. The sound is comparable to earphones worth 500-700Rs with a robust build quality. The sound signature is almost balanced with the treble being boosted a notch which I personally like, the bass is there when needed and isn't boosted which brings out other qualities in music and doesn't drown out other frequencies in most cases, the mids are quite clear as well. Eq is a must for reaching the full potential of these buds. These are great with smartphones but unexpectedly also with laptops and Desktops even for gaming and movies. Unbeatable at the price range of 299-350Rs. The mic is average but very usable and can easily be used for recording content or for communication in calls or voice chat while gaming. All in all it's a phenomenal deal, go for it.

This was a replacement product which I got because the previous product seemed used and had no seal. This time again the product seemed used. It was missing extra ear wings, was packed in a plastic bag and the wires that come attached to each other in new products, were already pulled apart. I say this comparing to the same product that I ordered a week ago which was perfectly packed with proper protection and all the extra tips and ear wings.This is the same thing for which I requested a replacement, but even this has the same problem.

Earphone is good with decent sound quality. Only thing is the buds are not soft enough so cannot wear it for longer duration, like more than 10-15 minutes.I replaced them with another pair of buds I had from my previous earphones which made it more comfortable.Also it's made in china.

Ordered After reading so much positive reviews . Almost every body said it has got clear soothing vocal and perfect treble with average bass.but after using 2 3 days I realised the music is hurting my ear ,got mild headache after constant using for 2 hours. To feel the bass , the sound level need to be increased but at the same time music vocal level becomes more irritating. Build quality is perfect. May be this earphone suits you but not in my case.so I returned it on 3rd day of using. If you have same budget then just go for MI BASIC EARPHONE blindly. you won't regret. Thank u

Overall this product let me down. The first delivered item, Mic was not at all working so I asked for replacement. For replacement, Mic is working but there is extreme disturbance. Don't even think of using this for Phone/Internet calls, person on other side will get huge noise despite you are sitting in quite area. On other side, the sound quality from its ear piece is good looking at price range. At high sound, you get good bass.

There was no response to the same untill I called up. After long wait the guy just took complaint number, put me on hold and then disconnected. I recieved a mail later that product will be replaced.This is the last communication and despite speaking to the customer care no ETA of replacement product has been shared.I would not recommend this product or brand to anyone. 2 out of my 3 products has gone bad and had to be repaired or replaced.The customer care is not responding properly despite I patiently asking for update on status.---------------------------Using for my office calls.

Am using it for more than 6 months, use it during walk / jog (that means sweaty condition). During lockdown and work from home condition, this is hanging on my neck almost all day.Its durable, has decent sound quality, snug fits, decent bass, the mic works like wonder.Given the price it can spar with other brands for its space.Its a genuine feedback, its worth every dime.

Bought these for 300. Mic wasn't working properly. Amazon kindly replaced my earphones at no extra cost(Thanks). However the new ones came with other issue. The audio mutes and unmutes just by shaking the chord. Again Amazon came to my rescue offering to return the product and refund the whole cost. I believe the company spent a fortune to advertise their sub quality earphones or just that my luck has been too bad. Whichever it is, I am not going to buy boult again even if I am getting a good deal. It's just not worth the time

Firstly, it's a product for which one should blindly go with.Price is like you are investing in a worthwhile deal.Micro woofers works well with efficient bass.I also never felt the surroundings noise made any disturbances while you have plugged them inn. I found a proper reduction in background noise.Incoming voice and outgoing as well, both are loud and clear always.Just a minor con I felt is speaker have little distortion which gives screeching sometimes.Talking about the body of product, it is actually a tangle free and comes with 3 pairs of ear-support and buds, both of different sizes. 2 pairs are in pouch with the box and 1 pair is stock one.You will get a warranty card along with the product, inside box by which you can register from the day of purchase and warranty can be claimed in between the promised time period.It feels good when a company provides a worthwhile product to their customers and within the affordability, also with the warranty whether the product price is low or costlier.Happy with the purchase.Thanks Boult. :)*not a paid review, just a true emotions, felt like should support the service they've for their customers.

First, mic - poorif you are planning to use these for meetings or calls, don't buy, the mic quality is really poor.Second, sound- midWell the headphones sound quality was good when arrived, but it didn't last long. I purchased them a week ago, and they are already broken. I need to reinsert them again and again until they stop annoying noise they produce.SummeryI think i may have received a defective, if so, they are still a reasonable choice for sound... Though my friends review with the mic is same as mineAns cons are already explain, better go buy some safe to use headphones rather than throwing your money away on these.And yeah, its design hurts the ear

I bought this product after considering many other competitive products online.And honestly, I am disappointed.The product build quality is very good. The wire is sturdy and looks unbreakable.But the sound quality is not so good. It is very loud and bass is good. But everything appears to be flat or suppressed as the noise is highly distorted. The clarity is very low. It's like playing in an big arena.The inbuilt mic is good. Didn't feel any disturbances while speaking and clarity was good.The ear buds are hard and causes pain on long use.

Got it for ₹349! And I am not disappointed! As this brand is kinda new to the market i was a bit confused as if I should go for this or not! But I decided to give it a shot and this has been a great deal!Bass is great! No complaints on sound quality or anything! Its just 5/5!Noise cancellation is something that i expected to be a little better! But I think its my phone's fault as earlier earphones which I used (Boat 242, JBL, Mi basic earphones and Soundmagic), didn't have noise cancellation too!Altho it sometimes get tangled up but its okay considering the price which I bought it for!In my opinion it is better than most of its competitors in this price segment, AND IT IS CHEAPER!Go for it if you're looking for something cheap! Yet brandish product!Definitely better than Mi Basic, Boat 242!

Using this for a month now and I really liked the product. Price and quality good. Good for rough tough use, as this is first time I'm not buying earphones, coz every month I've to buy but this product has lasted for a month *touchwod*Wow, second month completed successfully. The earphones are working just fine. No ear pains or entangled issues. I'm really happy purchasing it as it served purpose of longevity and sound quality. Highly recommend this..

This is a good buy , no doubt at this price @284 bucks.I have a suggestion, if you find the following1.Slightly heavy bass2. Poor quality or unclear sound.Do the following..Use small earplugs sponge out of the three sizes given with the FG.Change the equalizer setting in your mobile by reducing the bass.Result will be impressive.

I have House of Marley, Infinity, Skullcandy, Boat earphones. I have no idea why people are saying that these earphones are not upto the mark, got no bass, sound crackles at high volume. Being a music lover. I tried these ear phones on different genres. They are LOUD on specific genres. This may not give you the boomy bass but it sure has a nice soft thumping bass. The audio profile on bass and treble side is very much balanced. The mids and vocal are a little tight which increases the music effect and may reduce the vocals. But the treble side makes up the vocals. The ear loop keeps the earbuds tight without falling off.  I received a genuine product. Able to register for the warranty online. How you can identify the fake ones is by noticing that the Boult logo is missing on the mic next to Boult print. This is my first day and iam loving it.

I was sceptical on the Audio quality and the reviews online, but when I tested it myself with my Asus ROG Phone II, it sounds excellent with the clear punch of right amount of beats with appropriate bass and treble which is crisp in other words.I have used this for Official calls with my laptop, the audio quality has been crystal clear on the other side and I was able to hear very clearly as well.Used it on MS Teams, Zoom, Skype for Business, WhatsApp.I recommend this product basis my observation upon usage. Thanks

It does what it says .Bass quality is good enough for the price.Treble is high.I wanted a daily driver with toughness and it delivers.I don't like bluetooth devices and this serve the purpose.Not that much comfortable in ears but good enough and at this price * 200 bucks * , I don't have any complaints.

It's good, basically I use the things very roughly. I thought any product will be damaged by me within 1 r 2 months . I use this earphones maximum roughly but with very little care(that I used to put it in a pouch after using). I purchased it in feb2021 It's the 5th month and I'm very happy .. it's very worthy, (only extra buds are given)I'm happy with boult 😊 thank you amazon .

Actually, I Bought This Earphone For The Mic It Had, Cor Chatting On Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces.  The Mic Is Good But No Noise Cancellation, Plus The Noise Of Fan And Other Surrounding Amplifies More. Then ,I Thought Ok, I Will Use It As A Regular Earphone For Calling and listening Music.Calls Caught Lot Of Noise From Mic, and Earphone Quality, Not Up To The Mark !The Biggest Problem Being, It Does Not Fit Properly In 3.5 mm jack. It Feesls Like Some Rejected Item From Some Rejected Country.If It Doesn't Fit, How Would You Expey To Work Properly ?

Lets Talk about the product in detail:(FOR ALL THE TEST's THAT I DID, I USED LENOVO K8+ WHICH HAS *DOLBY ATMOS* BUILT IN)(So maybe your audio experience may have some difference)Inside the box:1.Earphone2.Carry pouch3.Extra Earbuds (S,M,L)4.Shirt Clip5.Warranty CardThat's all inside the boxAbout the product:1.Build Quality - Super Sturdy and amazing design. Looks Cool, Feels Cool!(Although the earphones are a little bit heavy like Boat Bassheads 22)2.Noise isolation - Total Isolation if you pick the right fit Earbuds.3.Highs and Mids (Clarity) - It is a really good sounding earphones with amazing ClarityYou can actually feel the True HD audio around You!4.Bass - The bass is punchy and Strong. Deep bass, It feels like you are actually wearing a subwoofer in your Ears!5.Mic - Sounds good, its placed just close to your mouth which provides better quality.6.Wire Quality - Really strong and looks like it is actually Kevlar coated!Overall:Pros-The earphones are really worth the priceIt actually sounds like a Earphone around 2500RsEverything is perfect from Bass to Clarity, from Build to Performance.Cons-Actually they should have kept the LOOP for Support as a temporary Thingcuz it starts to hurt after long use.IMPORTANT NOTE: You will have to adjust your EQUALIZER To get the best out of it......That's all from my sidego buy and check for yourself.....Thank You...!

I bought this product believing it to be a quality bass producing product but it's not. I used this product on Samsung, Realme, Oppo and Xiaomi smartphones.In neither of these devices I got a decent bass like as it boasts on the page. I also tried adjusting equaliser in each device to achieve optimum sound quality but it was no use. It only provides with average quality of sound and at high volume the quality erodes further.Positive- It fits well and good if you are planning to use outdoors or in gym. I am impressed with the quality of wire's material and also it's a tangle free so it's easy to handle. Externally it has got some looks.Overall it's a average product with low bass. One can go for this product confidently who are not in search of thumping bass producing Earphones.

Got this on thev1st Aug 21 & today is 30th Aug 21, it's one side is not working as volume of it' s bud is very less, only second side bud is working.  This is in just 29 days less than a month. Please don't buy its wastage of money. I think if we buy it from a street vendor & if  works same then at least you will save some money. Thus I say this set is not superior than a local & cheap product.

Good sound quality for the price. Good stereo seperation, can be used for gaming to hear foot step and identify left and right. Comes with long and good quality cable.

If you need a durable earphone this model should be your last choice 👎.Very bad product and very bad service...I decided to dumb this earphone.Thank you Boult audio for this wonderful experience.(My brother brought boat earphone and it's still at its best...I suggest everyone that earphone)

Well it's pretty good earphone but the noise cancellation is not up to the mark and the Jack is  not exactly at 90° it's somewhat at 120°. But overall it's  good I like it. You can buy it and also it is somewhat tangle free and the size of wire is perfect. It will be best when you use them with Dolby Atmos.

Please don't go for boult earphone. In past I purchased many earphones like Mi, Boat, Nokia, Schenhiser there sound output was good according to their price but this boult bassbuds X1 are the worst. If u are true music lover then you immediately make out the difference between high end, low end, treble, bass etc. This earphones have only bass that too bad,. And due to excess bass the real sound quality is pathetic there is no low end or high end difference there is only bass and shalow sounding music. Please go for mi or boat. If you can push your budget then I will suggest to buy Schenhiser HD 206 headphones, just listen to that sound and u will realise what real music sounds like, many music producers also use this Schenhiser headphone to make songs. It costs 1350 but if u can go for that then atleast go for Mi or Boat. Please avoid this boult earphones, they sound pathetic and this extra bass also create pain in ears.

Pros:-1. Overall good premium sound quality at Rs300 range. If you want very loud sound go for boat Bassheads 100.2. Microphone Quality is very good.3. Noise Cancellation is also upto the mark.4. Bass equivalent to sound quality.5. Clarity is perfect even at lower volume.6. They provide 2 sets of additional earbud and earloop pairs of variable size. With right set they are quite sporty and doesn't slip off.7. Partially water-resistant (not water-proof).8. Wires can handle few rigid handlings without any problem. Wire size is long enough.9. Google Assistant and Siri are both functional. (Long press the mic button for 2-3sec to use)Cons:-1. Built Quality could be better. Earphone is light metal built. ***Cables are not braided.(Almost same as boAt Bassheads 100 maybe better).2. Cables are not fully tangle free as claimed.3. Control terminal over mic is plastic built.4. Sometimes can be painful for ears if you dont adjust the right size earbuds and earloops.5. No carry pouch unlike boAt Bassheads 100.6. ***Earbuds are not magneticFinal Review:-If you want premium sound with clarity over loud sound definitely go for this product.If you want very loud sound go for boAt Bassheads 100.If you are a Spotify premium user or a Prime Music user definitely go for product over Boat.I use Realme earbuds 2, Boult Audio BassBuds X1 and Boat Bassheads 100 and any day my preferences will be...realme Buds 2 (For Built)(Rs.599) > Boult Audio BassBuds X1(Rs.299) >>> boAt Bassheads 100(Rs.399)

This earphone is just too good for the price tag. I purchased it looking at the reviews. Though I was not expecting a good sound at this price range but was surprised. Bass is really good and vocals are clear as well.  I just felt clarity should have been bit better as at times it does sounds bit jammed. But at 300 Rs, one cannot really expect much. I can purchase this again if the one I have breaks. It's really that good.

well first talking about the built quality is so good the cables are strong this is called built quality like i used so many earphones like boat ant audio real me etc etc. but none of them were good in built quality they lasted long month 8 7 but this earphones is good value for money even for sound quality and gaming purpose but i guess somehow i felt like left and right are not balanced sound were coming that's only otherwise at this segment u will not get this kind of good quality earphones cheers to BOULT go for it no regrets.

66the Person to write a review here. And also i was the 97th person to write the Review of Boult Loop in ear.Both the earphones are best at this price. No other Earphones are half as good as them. I used Boult in ear for more than a Year. And I have been using this for last 2 days.Sound Quality is somewhat same in both of them. Although Bassbuds has little bit better Base (Although not that much difference).Aldo Bassbuds are better in Looks.But when you Talk about comfort, Loop in ear is a lot better as Compared to Boult Bassbuds.I'm telling you the sound in Both of them are 99% similar. No such Noticeable difference, but Loop in ear are very much comfortable and good for Long use.But I suggest you don't go for any other brand earphones and Buy any of the Two without any second thoughts.

This earphones are good in terms of usage and Quality.Sound is perfect with good bass and treble upto 70-80% then it treble exceeds the bass and lyrics becomes very loud.But sound quality is better than average and it's very durable too.Looking for a good choice under 500 this is a go.Other options are available i chose this one because American Brand and great Items. So you can buy it look for new brand and Quality with 1 year of Warranty against Manufacturing defect

Before writing this I would like to tell you buyers to really think about it if you would really waste money on it. First I bought it bcoz the reviews were max positive but alas for me in the end my earphones failed badly. How? Well at first it seemed ok🙂 sound came not dat impressive but then average type. No bass btw. LoL. No noise cancellation at all. On the 3rd day the jack wasn't compatible on my phone. Mind you. And then again on 4th day when I tried it on another phone I used it for my meeting calls in the middle the mic got busted my colleagues didn't hear anything from me talking. At all. Boult is a brand I couldn't trust anymore. Failed to keep its character. The sound quality isn't dat high. Think before buying. I couldn't return or refund it because I threw the bill and warranty card. As I thought I won't be needing it. I regretted that after 3 days 😆😭 stupid piece of earphones I ordered. Just disappointing.

Nice headphones best build quality the base, clarity, sound quality are all awesome,,,,!!!! the only thing is that out of the box headphones are not exactly weighted towards bass side but more of towards concertation side but once you tweak the equilizer in PC or Mobile phone a bit and BOOM!!!...  your ears and mind will be in for a treat...they are capable of handelling every settings you throw at your equilizer and can also be very loud and clear ,noise cancellation is Good and the best things is support for years, was never to use the BUD type earphone but the supporters in this one hold the earphone very nicely if i break my this earphone i am surely going to buy this again...

Microphone was not working. I dispatched the product to their Delhi service centre at my own cost. They were quick enough to replace/repair but that product also had the same issue. Had to dispatch again at my own cost and now waiting for product. Product quality has deteriorated now. Customer support responds at their own will. Will never be back to Boult.
"

While using the earphone, I saw a few days later that the earphone jack is slightly bent. It was maybe a physical damage, but I never used the product in harsh manner. I always kept it coiled and this happened after 1 month of purchase. Obviously the return window was closed but the warranty period was active. So, I complained on Amazon and they redirected me to Boult Audio. I lodged a complaint but after a long time, they responded by saying that we are shipping back the product and it's details will be shared via email. I never got an email back from Boult enclosing shipping details. Again on complaining on Amazon, they said me to lodge a new complaint.  Customer at the end gets captured in the vicious cycle.If they couldn't ship the product, they could have said it clear cut in an email. Sound quality was good but boult has ruined my expectations.Moral - If you ever face a difficulty in these earphones, nobody is gonna be bothering to help you. CHOOSE WISELY... PRICE IS NOT JUST ONE FACTOR... CUSTOMER SUPPORT ALSO MATTERS!!! 🙏🏻

Acually the earphones r good and vaule for money nice bass when ur listening to a song and nice build quality also but what i have gone dispointed is there is no up and down buttons for increasing volume and changing for the next song there is a button in the middle for taking phone calls only clearity is fine and one thing i noiticed that when ur talking to some one in earphones u have to keep the mic near to ur mouth otherwise ur words is not clearly hear to other person

Why value for Money?- bought it for 349/-- Got delivered the next day within 24 hours- i found the wire to be pretty decent actually. Its not filmsy and it feels premium for its price.- Good Design and Ergonomics, means fits good in ears and is comfy.- im pretty tall so the headphones are long enough to fit in my ear perfectly without stretching it from my pocket so i really like that.- Bass is pretty good. And i also boult TWS and they have pretty good bass too. Pretty Decent for hindi, punjabi and bollywood music.What could have been better?- the mids are flat and could have been better. So these are not ideal for Rock Songs. But could easily be changed with Equalizer.- lows are pretty flat and again can be changed with Equalizer.- Although, mic is decent but couod have been more louder and clearer.But overall its a great value for money. I recommend it buying.

The quality of the product was very pathetic. Even no clarity in audio also. The finishing of the product, logos printed etc looked cheap. The same day itself I have submitted return request. When the seller received the product they reported they got duplicate product. So my doubt was genuine. The product they shipped to me might be a fake/duplicate. I never expected this from Appario Ltd. But Amazon customer care  people found I were genuine and initiated my refund. Mr. Appario retail please look into this very seriously. I never expected this from seller like you.

In the very first use earphones are judged by the quality of sound, which is absolutely very good (9/10).Later I looked for the Bass and volume,which incomparable (10/10). No other product has this good bass/volume.In the perspective of voice calls. The communication has no disturbance and microphone is working fine. This seems to be a maintaining its promise in noise cancellation with experience (8/10)This is the most important,the DESIGN, which is flexible to everyone. The earplugs are designed just in a way that it will fit into earsso easily and stays there so long without straining. Good thing is you can wear this while working out, travelling, doing multi task etc., because this has ear holders which makes this more worthy. You have different size both for earplugs and ear holders included(10/10).Other good reason for praising design is curve at the jack plug which makes the earphones to last long. (9/10)Overall : 9/10Just go for it, I say

Bluetooth headset quality is OK. But ear plugs provided are of poor quality. Ear plugs are loosely fitted. Lost 2 pairs in 4 days. When contacted customer care to arrange ear plugs, they have asked me to courier headset to Delhi. Local servise support is not there. Customer care executives were behind me to give good review, not bothered to replace ear plugs. So device is of no use now.

Let's start with the build and looksThe build quality is quite nice and attractive even i ordered in red color bcoz no other color options not available at that time & i realized tha red color (but you can go for blue) is also very attractive and it is the one & only earphones that have metal eartips seriously very premium looking with embeded boult logo looks great. I think that there is a con with these earphones no magnet bcoz before these earphones i am a user of realme buds 2 which cost around 599rs somethingBut when i compared to these boult earphones with other earphones in this segment no one gives you that premium build quality.Now the sound signature is very loud, good & impressive bass is enough around 70% vol. & 100%(if you are listening old 90s songs) anyways bass is quite good considering the price of rs 299. Treble is also good i tried BGMI or PUBG whatever you say nothing difference. In game stereo separation is good lefts and rights are easy to detect and it has an L-shaped jack which is very excellent while you are holding your phone you never feel uncomfort while playing games or multimedia consumption. Noise cancellation is decent not upto the mark remember that it is a 299rs earphones so don't expect from noice cancelation feature. Now the wire quality is made up of cavilar wires which is normal in this price you may not get any braided wires but quality is good. Now why i am returning this bcoz my ears are very small seriously you can say that my ears looks like a 3 or 4 year old baby & earphones are big for my ears but it's a subjective if ur ears are. Normal size and bigger you face no problem. I like senhessier cx 180 type earphones very small and lightweight. So final conclusion is that the if you are looking a wired earphones under 300 or 349 (depend upon what color you choose) best earphones full recommended from my side

They sent an earphone with a design different from what is shown in the product image page. Sound quality is also not that good. I don't know why it's called bassbuds. It should be called treblebuds. So much treble. Even 30 minutes of continuous use will give you headache and ear pain. Build quality is somewhat good. Not satisfied with this product. For Rs.350 you should buy boat's earphone instead.Update: I ordered a replacement and the new earphone has some cracking sound and too much treble again. So if you have too much money and you don't bother wasting 349rs then you can buy this otherwise don't.

The quality u get in this range 300-350 is quite superb. Amazing performance.The only issue i found  is the design of  male jack.Its like elongated L shape. I reaaly like the sharp L shaped jack which helps in easily keeping phone on floor tilted.The wites are all strong and very colored guite wonderful.Overall 4.3/5.If ur range is 350 and u need a quality sound and a year warranty then go for it.

As per rate these earphones are best.1) packaging was good2) delivered on given date3) best part is that it fits accurately . Falling or displacement is a rare scenario.4) sound quality is awesome.5) Do not heat the ears after long period .( Most of earphones generally heats ears which may lead to head ache)6) because of its soft tip ,it can also be used as earplugs.7) Mike has large range . U don't need to put mike near your mouth to be clear and loud.8) only cons is something it is irritating to find which one is right or left.Warranty period is long as per price.So it's a good one.I have been using it from 4 months and it's still running awsome.

Clearly the people who wrote review previously does not know bass? I agree audio is loud in this earphone but bass is not present. Pitch is too high and so ear will hurt in couple of minutes. Looks like they install a jhankar beats in it. Music does not feel good. It feel painful. Avoid using it if you want to listen music and watch movies.

I bought the red one thinking it would be a burgundy shade, however it was more of a red vermillion shade which was equally cool.For the Rs 349 that I paid, it is definitely worth. In fact worth more. The package is good and contains two additional earbuds and two additional ear hooks. The black ear hooks come in three sizes- small, medium and large. Medium is attached to the the earphone in the package. I tried changing to the large size which is is tight fitting on my ear but it pains after long use. I returned to medium size which I think fits most people perfectly and comfortably.  The three ear hooks can be distinguished by the small dots on the inner side, so that we don't mix up. I loved this attention to detail.As for the sound the bass is really good and passive noise cancellation is decent for the price we pay.  The  earphone cables are sturdy, and does not get tangled in the pocket. Couple of times I pulled on it and twice my phone fell pulling the attached earphones stretching the cables badly, but it has withstood all this rough use. The earphone pin is attached on the cable in an obtuse angle which is a very sensible thought as it bends and stretches correctly and minimally when watching a video or a call on phone.I attached it on an MI Bluetooth receiver and it worked well as a  Bluetooth earphone. The mic was so good it captured the whispered sounds when I recorded with the phone in the other room.Boult is an emerging brand and I hope they develop a better logo and font going ahead. That's the only part that makes it feel not premium.Overall a decent purchase I cherish.

It has been close to 3 months since I've been using these earphones now. One of the best earphones I've used and I'm really amazed at the price point they came at. I've used bose, Sennheiser and other Chinese brands and I'm blown away by this not so well known indian brand. I like them so much that I've decided to buy the bluetooth earbuds from the same company to give them a try

After using the earphones around for 3 months. Few observations:- Basic sound levels- In mobile other side able to hear us nicely, average noise cancellation of the mic- In office calls using laptop and MS Teams, other side can not hear me loudly if I use these earphones. So useless at tat point.- After very minimal use of these earphones around 3 months right side earphone's volume decreased slightly as compared to the left side- As purpose of buying this for me was office calls with wired earphone, as pairing and connecting the a Bluetooth earphone to the office laptop is pain, so these are not useful for me- Apart from I am suing Soundcore Liberty 2, awesome experience with them. Boat Rockerz 510 .. average experience with them

Wondering how this product for such good ratings?? Well the company calls you after you register for warranty and says that they are giving rewards for breast reviewes. They'll ask you for your reviews screenshot and will give you nothing. Beware.Although build quality is good for such price range and noise cancellation is good. One problem is that my ears hurt after using these.

Well balanced audio, Good enough to play PUBG. The wire is not braided but seems to be tough. Although braided ones are better. I USE THIS for xbox, works pretty well for me. Has good surround sound, you can map movements (in Pubg) or footsteps pretty accurately. Headphone shell made out of metal and plastic. The added weight makes it feel premium. They could improve the acoustics but more than enough for this price point.

Its funny to say that i haven't boight this headphone for a headphone rather for its extra ear hook. Does it seem wierd???....yes it is but the fact is i loved the headphone as well. I am not a song freak so cant tell u the bass treble and all but yes it seem really good headphone for novice like me. Best part is its extra hook. I have boat rockerz 255 wireless and its hook were lost so i tried the hook provided by this one and voila.....it really fit well. Now my wireless headphone works lioe charm...i kwpt this wored headphone for emergency use only in case the battery in boat rockerz dies in the middle.

The earphone ergonomic design is very innovative and fits perfectly in your ears .Although I very much appreciate this product ,it is let down by non magnetic and minimal button.But hey for its price segment its better than Jbl itself since I've purchased both the products I'd recommend this product to any consumers and cutomers.

Packaging was not as expected, like someone has already messed with it. So, disappointed by that.Pros -1. Very good material has been used.2. Nice built quality, looks professional.3. Sound quality is really nice and crisp. Nice bass, good noise cancellation. The one who loves the vocals clarity, gonna love this.4. Fits in nicely and comfortably. Thanks for the accessories provided with package.5. Microphone works very nicely, clear voice over calls.6. Inline control also works nicely.Cons -1. Microphone position is bit odd, as compared to the earphones comes now a days. But, you won't feel any lag though. It works fine.

Considering the segment in which this product falls I would say it is one of the best products u would get at this price. I bought this for daily usage due to work from home and I am very much satisfied with the performance so writing this review after 2 weeks of usage.Everyone has a different expectation and perception of a product so for me these are the pros and cons.Pros :1)Value for money2)Clear sound with adequate base for daily usage3)Good build quality4)Untangles easily5)HandyCons: if I list the cons it would be very demanding considering the price of the product.

Firstly I don’t know what are some people complaining about there being a lack of bass because the bass is fantastic on this one. It blocks outside noise very well when the music is playing and the sound is crystal clear. I honestly can’t believe that these cost as low as 300 bucks. If I did I blind test I would’ve sworn these are some high end earphones. Very good. Also I’d like to add that they are much better sounding than Realme buds 2 and other bOAt earphones which are double the price of these Boult earphones. I’m damn impressed.

 Iast time I ordered bolt wireless earbuds , that was good .so I ordered this...but this time 😞 disappointed. Sound may good but noise cancellation is not good. While receiving a call or talking during the call is very problematic and horrible. My god next time no to Boult. I'm sorry 😔.

I was looking for a wired headphone set for my online meetings. The voice clarity is great. It's ideal of calls and general music listening. If you're looking for something with deep bass, this isn't your bet. The quality of the headphones is good and comes with a tangle free wire. Fitting is very comfortable in the ear with the additional rubber horns.

*Mic* is crap when i sent a whatsapp voice it sounded horrific its that bad ! sound output and fit is all worth money nothing out of world nor bad its fine!Package appears to be damaged, although product inside looks fine in inital inspection and seems working..value for money! nothing else to discribe this u can't say fault on this at 299!!I personally like sony's signature sound this is not that level specially XB series sony level! thats super clear vocal and lowend and mid and nice bass! And when i used jbl Tune 110 i was just disappointed how ever i feel this X1 is that itsbetter than that jbl one and cost1/3 and sweat proof too  and in terms of comfort its not bad nor great although fit is great not gonna fall of while moving ! And thats good !if u don't want 50 or 100 rs cheap headphone go for this kind of budget ones its minimum needed for some gaming or music experience !

For me, this product last for 10 months.Sound is good, good noise cancellation.But I'm giving 2 stars because when a week later after I  ordered, its says arriving today. And Idk how tf it took more than a month to delivered it to me. The package was already open, the extra ear buds were missing. I didn't return this product because I really needed a headphone at that time and i couldn't bear to wait more days. I was really pissed off.👎

Bass Boult X1 are a great pair of earphones to own and they come at a very attractive and affordable price too. I purchased the ""Blue-Black"" color variant and received it a couple of days back. The company packages the earphones in a cute little box with a Warranty Registration card in it.  I opened the packing and was greeted to stunning and premium looking Boult X1 Earphones. So sporty, so amazing and when I put it on, the angled ear plugs fit snug into my ears. Very ergonomically designed. Even the ear tips are so soft and the product also comes with attached set of rubber fins to make the earphones fit snugly into your ears. They also give you 3 additional sets of ear tips and ear fins , all of varying sizes to fit different ear sizes , to make every user feel comfortable when using Boult X1. You can run or exercise without worrying that your earphones would fall off.  Coming to the sound quality of the earphones ..I must say ..It's crystal clear and the Instrument separation is great.  Vocals are clear too. Treble is good and Bass is adequate. Bass will not be so thumping so as to overpower the song or the words spoken in a video or audio etc..  These earphones give you rich , adequate bass to help you enjoy music without that bang bang bang bass of other earphones that gives you a headache. Boult X1 has a well balanced Sound signature.The earphone mic quality is absolutely amazing and I called atleast 3 different people in different states of India to test this on different mobile networks and everybody said that my voice was crystal clear.Noise cancellation is just ok.  We can hear outside sounds when we plug in these earphones too. However lower noise cancellation is in a way  a safety feature too,  as it may help you hear outside sounds of vehicles etc ... when you are walking or jogging alongside the road listening to music using these earphones.Coming to warranty..Registration of warranty was a breeze too. It took me just 2 mins to register my earphone on boult.com website and I received a confirmation mail  instantly, stating my product is now registered successfully under 1 year of Warranty.In summary..Boult X1 is one of the Best sounding , economically priced and premium looking earphones in India.  Anyone can buy this without a second thought. Enjoy your music and stay safe friends.

Pros-1- Loudness is too good.2- treble and highs are perfect3- bass is perfect at 60-70% volume(my experience)4- Design is amazing5- headphone pin is designed perfectly for gaming, it doesn't bother the fingers.6- mic input is much better than mi or boat.7- it comes with earlock which fits perfectly and works good.8- since earlocks and fit is perfect for me, it also works for Noise cancellation.Cons-1- Mids and lows are decent( my experience)2- volume above 80% disrupts audio quality (my experience)3- wire quality is decent, its thin above mic which feels like its gonna break. But it doesn't so + for that.4- comfort is good, like I can't wear these for more than 3 hours(tested)Verdict-If you are gamer, these are one of the best because i personally feel that comfort on fingers and mic are important for gaming. There's no lag faced by me.If you are buying these for calling and multi-media, these are good no doubt. But if you spend Little more you can get better.Overall, i think these are perfect if you purchase at best price. I personally don't like wired earphones because of wire tangling obviously. Other than that these are amazing. I am using these since 4 months now. And at this price range, this is one of the best you can get.

FirstlyDon't buy cause seller doesn't give return option so you're stuck with it andIts not even worth 20 rs.This earphone has no bass, and its sound stays supressed and suddenly rises to very high. This causes so much irritation in ears and the ear tips are not at all soft you will be throwing it away. Sound quality is not even a quality to rateIt is like listening to songs without any instrument just voice.

Was looking for a decent wired earphone, and came across this product on YouTube, and decided to buy it. I'll say I don't regret buying this at all! Hands down the best wired earphone in this range! Totally loved it quality and performance it's delivering. It's been more than 4 months of using this daily for my online lectures and youtube, but the performance is still the same! The best part about Boult is, it came with an one year warranty, you just have to register on the website. I don't believe you'll get such warranty in this price range! I totally recommend everyone who is looking for a wired earphone. I have used Boat wired earphone earlier, but one side used to stop working after some time! But this Boult product jave not disappointed me at all. I have ordered one more Boult loop earphone after using this product. 5star from my side.

Sound and noise cancellation are ok. But they aren't tough enough, Kevlar coated and all are just words I am not seeing them materialised hereSorry... These aren't for tough handling one bite from my kitten and all the kevalar and tough charade ended. Waste of money

I bought if after I read the reviews here. So much so I checked out a few reviews from YouTube as well. The sound quality is simply sub-par. It isn't good , and I don't necessarily blame Boult or anything ,for the price it is satisfactory. Don't be fooled by the reviews here. This is not something I plan to use more than 6 months.One plus side, the buds fits really well. Thus the 3 stars.

Nice earphone with this price range.. decent quality not that high quality but it's okay with this price. Sound quality is good but noice cancellation is not upto the mark. Extra ear holder and buds are + point. Quality of wire need improve and best quality and earpiece are to me metallic. But in this price what you more expect? Overall good... Rest need to check that how long it last and about its coustomer service. Packaging is also good. I get this on 299/- go for it

Comes with good packaging..Sound quality is awesome.. as I order 2 more other brands to compare..The snug fit is light weight and no issue wearing for long duration..Cable is long, strong, may be durable I suppose..The headphone jack angle is also unique...nor horizontal/ nor vertical..45degree setup of plug works perfect for holding phone.Overall, Good one to listen to music and videos..And great product in this budget..

1. Build quality is very good. No straglling wires anymore and no more cracks near to 3.5 mm kack connector.2. Surprisingly it provides 2 extra pairs of ear hooks  😍😍😍 its wow... I have used it for my other earphones 😉😉 check attached photo.3. Sound quality is very good, its very loud I mean seriously loud to disconnect you from the world.. Noise cancellation works very well👍👍4. You may need to adjust equalisers on your phone to get desired sound experience as I did it for mine..Overall it execceded my expectation considering price.

Yes i was impressed by the sound quality you get in this price range i would suggest boult over boat but when it comes to battery backup this thing cant last more then 4 hrs on full charge not satisfied and main thing is even if its charged 100% its comes to 60% and when it reaches 30% it keeps on reminding you to keep it for charging and that is irritating. Hope they work on it soon.

Edit-Reward Scam - After receiving the earphone I got a message on what's app saying that if I give a good review, I'll get some reward. To test this claim I did post a great review and have been waiting for 1 month for the reward, but haven't received any.So in conclusion all the out of the world reviews that you see for this product is fake and only written for the sake of the so called reward.Actual ""Reward"" review-If you're looking for something with good sound quality, amazing style and a good fit this is the Earphone.And to add to it It's budget friendly.

Dear friend,Sound wise it is good but it seems not even travel for a year with continuous usage.I'm using for 5 month continuous but sound and mic wise good for lap but the same mic not good mobile call. I check with some phones but not fine with calls.My head phone button is not working.So, I reached customer service by mail but they told me to sent this to courier.I'm in chennai and they are in delhi. Courier charge is 72 rupees. I bought it just 299. So it is not worth to send and the told me to ready for service but not replace.So no worth to spend this amount for courier. So, Please once twice think before choose boult.

I liked that it had huge sound... But not enough clarity, the sound gets tinny at higher volumes and I have to keep it at 30-40% of the full volume to get a non distorted sound... Even then the trebles get a bit tinny, the 'S' sound gets very amped... If you are not an audiophile and need this for simple purpose of listening to videos and music then its a good buy also very durable and good for rough use

This product has become my favourite pair of earphones. I was in search of earphones from a really long time and I tried this product and it was totally worth it. Noise cancellation is awesome and sound quality is astounding. This is the best product in this price range. Try once you'll never regret it.

I had to exchange the product thrice to make sure I got working earphones. I do not know if it's the company or the dealer. But they reseal the open earphones and send back for replacements. When you reach out to Boult they ask you to ship the product to Delhi instead of any local outlet or shop. I have used these earphones before but the ones they are selling now are really substandard.

Purchase the product a week ago. Have been satisfied with the performance so far. The bass is good. Earlier I was using boat 220 Basshead but Boalt product has better bass quality.The problem is that all my previous earphones lasted exactly one year which their warranty cover. Will update the review after one year.Would have been better if they could have provided a case/cover for the earphone

There's sheer quality, and there's outrageous pricing with quality.I've used expensive headphones, ones that cost in the thousands, and I've lost them, broken them and so on and so forth.My point of the opening rant is simple. I got these earphones for less than INR 500.00 and was expecting a pair of earphones that did their job really. Calls and Music. Mainly calls (I didn't expect them to be even acceptable for music).But I couldn't be more wrong. Lemme explain:Sound Quality: These buggers punch way above their weight. Ridiculously high. The output (qualitatively speaking) they deliver could easily rival that of earphones costing 3 to 10 times the cost of these.Noise Cancelation: Top notch. They could easily cut out a siren on the street that's passing you by. Need I say more?Bass: Balanced and non-intrusive.Fit and Finish: Metallic body, you kidding me? No! Precise, no gaps, solidly put together. The cable may seem a bit flimsy, but who cares?Overall, at this price point, these stand very tall. Kudos to the people who are responsible for making these happen. If you're in the market for budget earphones, don't bother, just order it blindly. You won't regret your decision.The grey/silver ones I ordered look cool too!Some surprises are good, these are certainly it!!

I'll be honest for this product. I purchased this item in ₹299. As I opened it, I was amazed to see the built quality. It was far better than what I was expecting it to be. Sound quality was excellent, base was superb. Overall I was happy to have it in just ₹299. I wrote the review and gave 5 stars. Guys now it's very surprising to tell you what I have been facing. I was super happy untill I made a phone call with earphone plugged in. Mic was not working. I replaced the item, I got a new one. Everything fine but again mic was not working. I replaced for the third time. Again a tiny hole was there as a mic but that was not working. I came here in the product details. It shows that mic is available in the earphone but believe me I'm tired of replacing these items and it has no mic. It's really disappointing . Hats off to you Boult. And hats off to you Amazon for making it Amazon's choice. 👍

I have purchased this product (black colored ones) earlier, because of which I noticed a few cost cuttings (with red colored earphones) for eg:1. The sound quality has been degraded2. The whole plastic frame of call receiver used is feels like a cheap plastic now.3. The diameter of wire has been reduced significantly.All these issues leaves an impression with consumer that the product is not sturdy.This review is wrt red colored variant, not sure if the quality of the black colored ones is still intact or not.

Firstly talking about the price, I got it for around 350, something that I can expect to last 6 months.The reality - one week of usage, one side of the piece stopped working. Within 10 days from the date of purchase but boult didn’t replace the product. They rather “repaired” the product and sent it back with a pouch. I didn’t get the extra earbuds which I had sent back for replacement.Anyway poor customer service.Apart from that the sound quality is fair and there’s a lot of bass.

The product looks good and ratings was good so i bought it. Previously i have used 2 wonderful headphones. They are working awesome. But for this product X1 within 5day the microphone stop working. It did not even receiving sounds. I thought it is my laptop's fault. After 7days it stop working totally. Just 10days. And if you contact customer care they will tell you to courier them. It will cost more and takes 5-6 days. Please do not buy this one. Try different products of boult.

This is the only earphone in this price range that lasted quite a lot. Most others give problems within a few weeks. I would say this is incredible product, best in this price range in terms of durability. The only negative point I see is the buds do not fit into ear lobes very well and it is hard to decipher which one is left and which one right. But this is a minor thing and I would recommend this product - overall it is awesome.Update on 15Sep2021: After working exactly for one year, the right side earphone stopped working. Still it is better than other earphones, normally they won't last beyond 3-4 months at a maximum. But the volume control button won't work beyond a couple of months. It is true for all earphones I have used and this one is not an exception.

I received these earphones in 2 days as promised by Amazon. They come in nice small package which contains-1 Earphones2 Extra pair of Eartips2 Extra pair of Sharkfin Earhook1 Warranty registration cardSound Quality:1. Vocals are very clear, i felt no distortion at max volume as well.2. Bass is very balanced and even at low sounds you can feel that bass which is not expected in this range.3. Highs, Mids and Lows are crisp & clear maybe beacause of proper in-ear fit of these earphones.4. Passive Noise cancellation is not a new thing for in-ear style earphones and these too work great in that  department as well.Build Quality:This is the one department which made me rate it 5 out of 5 rather than 4. Build quality is great in this range. Plastic quality used in this is of high grade with brush metal finish which looks awesome. Tangle free design wire is used in this. It also comes with mic and single multifuntional button which can launch Google Assistant as well. Mic placement is near mouth position which is great since most of the other manufacturers provide it at the joint position of wire. 3.5mm jack is not L-shaped, it is more of in curved shape but does the job of preventing wire from any damage by regular bend in it.If you want to buy an earphone under 400 or even 500, i seriously suggest you these earphones. I'm sure they'll be worth it to you.

(Blue new ones and red older ones)I bought these as my brother had them and I really liked them. My brothers one was the first model. It had a metal junction. And the mic was on the wire of the right ear piece. He had been using them since an year or two. They kinda wore of and he used the warranty and got a replacement. Mine are the newer model X1, that is these ones.The L shaped junction is the same.Pros: I feel these are better fitting than the older version.The sound is clearer and bass is better than the older one.Cons: The new model has a plastic junction which has a mic as well(mic at the junction unlike the mic at the right ear piece) which makes the voice for the reciever less clear and less loud.I feel that the sound is a bit off than the older version.Noise cancellation was better in the older one.Feels less quality than the older model.Conclusion: Thought there are diff in the older and newer ones, these are the best quality earphones at this price range. My other brother paid 900 rs and bought JBL that didnt even last an year.At that price range you can buy 3 of these of which each one can last longer than 6 years collectively.  Hope this helps!

I have used many expensive earphones & after buying this earphone, I truly am amazed by the sound quality of it.I have weighed some pros & cons of this product after using this for 4 months.Pros:• Cheap• Good sound quality• Durable• Built quality is good (Wire quality is also good)Cons:• Sometimes wire gets Tangled (But all wired earphones gets tangled)These are valued for money earphones in my opinion. This earphone is cheap & effective for normal daily usage. If you are looking for earphones below ₹800/- then these are for you.

Overall great experience. The sound is outstanding in each section. Bass, treble n vocal up to the mark. At this price range, the quality is way better than expected.  Go for it without second thought if require wired earphones below 500. Especially for music lovers, can easily listen for more than hours conveniently as this pair doesn't hurt or irritate for long period usage. Sound and material design fits perfectly for ears.  Highlight of earphones are 3D sound effect ( can be experienced when head is moved in diff directions).

For this price point, it’s a tank. Fantastic audio quality & good build.But 2 cons. Mic position is way down where both wires meet. Product images mislead in someway. While speaking over a call, it sounds weak. I’m not returning it Just because of that wonderful sound quality.Other con is the jack shape. It’s neither L nor straight.

I have been using this product from last 3 Months and My experience is pretty good.

Rest is fine.

The sound quality that it produces is just mind-blowing and could also easily compete with earphones above it's pricerange. The most liked part is the stereo eperation and the sound stage that it produces, you can easily distinguish between different music instruments coming from different directions.The BASS is heart thumping as it has microwoofers.The Vocals are crystal clear. You can can easily consider them as gaming earphones.The TREBLEs are good but I think it could have been more sharp, though you can easily boost it through equalisation.So finally, in the pricerange of around ₹300 you will not find such a gem of a product.

Please avoid buying this model from boult due to the following reasons:1) The comfort is very poor.2) You will feel pain in your ears due the rough rubber of the buds.3) No volume +/- button and mic is not close to mouth leading to poor audio quality for calling/recording purpose.# THIS PRODUCT HAS NO RETURN POLICY#Audio quality is good, but it has nothing to do when have to compromise our comfort in ears.Guys seriously i would not suggest this product, instead go for some mi,realme or boat earphones with mic after watching some youtube reviews.

The sound quality isnt THAT bad (for the price) but the bass is literally too much. My equalizer being a classic V,  listening to metal on these earphones is a bit of a ""no-no"" case. They fit well enough in your ears. Not recommended for people who listen to music or play games(PC ofc *wink*) for a long period of time (Say 4+ hours continuously), ears start paining if the fitting is just a tad bit tight. Like Boat Bassheads 225 have a significantly better 'overall' audio quality.By no means are these bad earphones, just remember that there is no return option, you can only replace them.

The 3.5mm jack is gold colour plated, and the cable joint seems durable.The cable is thick and is soft rubber.The ear piece body had minor scuffs and dirt.Anyway cleaned with sanitizer and looks new.The right ear bud is damaged ( has a cut in it ). Which doesn't affect performance.Sound quality is amazing for its price range, lacks bass as I'm coming from boat bassheads 225.The bass is nice when tinkered with Equilizer.Mic quality is remember it doesn't have volume button.Got it for 350rs. Fit and finish is amazing

Typically best used for voice or listening to music with bass. Plain music gives a metallic sound. When connected to laptop (with Dolby enabled) the sound quality degrades a lot. The product is only good for daily calls/ listening to bass music. Ergonomic design helps fixing earphones slipping away from ear during movements. As stated in the product about 3D acoustics, I played few 3D audio, but didn't felt good. Product provides 1 year warranty.

Got damaged in just 10 days of use, how such a poor quality they can make?Even the customer care is so bad, they don't recieve the call, nor they reply over your msgs, it's like one's you get this you were totally cheated.Only the bass quality is somewhat good, nothing else, one of the worst earphones I ever bought, it cause somewhat problem in the ears, because fitting is not good .
"

It is good. I have been using it since 2 months. There is no issue with sound or with bass. There is is one problem I am facing is the audio jack is not universal it is is nearly bigger than Universal audio jack. I think it is bigger than 3.5 mm. When I connect it with my mobile it get disconnected because sometimes it gets out without pulling or touching so this is the only problem that I am facing otherwise the sound quality is good there is 10 mm drive so the sound is is good and distinctive. Mic is sometimes working and sometimes not working properly the other person cannot hear voice properly or distorted sound appear.

The earphones are very good fit to ear and provides good noise cancellation, but the only problem is that the mic doesn't work properly. So when I call via earphones, the person opposite to the call can't hear properly.I don't know its the problem with my one, or everyone is facing the mic problem!!

This headset is useless. No bass, instead of a bass you'll only hear a ""knock"" sound. When you rotate the 3.5 mm Jack when connected, the music stops & you must unplug & plug it back. No kevlar wires, their description is wrong, this hardware is a piece of crap. Btw, these Boult people will call & ask for a good review in return for a reward, but technically, you're not getting anything.

I purchased these for Rs. 350 and at the same time also brought JBL C100SI In-Ear Headphones with Mic (Red) for 600. I must say in comparison with the JBL one, these are better. I was myself amazed on how Boult can be better than JBL. The voice clarity and noise cancellation is terrific.I wanted to return the JBL and buy another Boult only, but JBL doesn't take return of any products. Hence, living with it.If you are looking for some amazing headphones, this is a must buy.

Sound quality is excellentBase is not that badNoice cancellation is pretty awesomeL shaped 3.5 mm connector having a lock feature it fits to your port perfectly u just need to give a liitle push (inwards) it will give you a click sound that means it's perfectly plugged in ..... (You will find the connector loosing that's why a liitle push is required)Cable quality is good but not braidedhave a good fit for earsMicrophone is not that good  it's a bit far away from your mouth you have to takeThe microphone and then speak only in order to access ""hey Google""

This is very uncomfortable on the ears.The design is such that the ear buds doesn't get stuck in the ears easily.More than 2/3 attempts required to fix it in the ears.After only few days, the caller at the other side is not able to hear voice. NOT RECOMMEND.

This is a manufactured in China, the quality of which is not special, you can buy 2 headphones from the market at this price,with same quality.  there is no difference between the quality of this headphone and which is available in the market for Rs. 150, and yes you cannot return it, it can only be exchange, so think before you go,

I cannot complaint about these because of their price. Yet, they offer amazing value for your money.Gold 3.5 mm angled headphone jack, in built microphone with a button for customisable commands, offers earwing silicons for more comfort and fit, sound quality is surprisingly good and doesn't sound like crap.

New review: now its has stopped working..only one ear part is working but that too not clear ....people who listen music everday 3-4 hrs..its nt recommendable...It was a good one....dint sustain longI bought this headset on urgent for my wfh meetings as my old Bluetooth headset (wings) worth 1500INR failed to connect n poor voice quality... I was surprised with the quality of this boult headset I bought at such low price.. Amazing sound quality, Almost Zero noise cancellation n I take meetings, I can record my voice for voice notes.. rehearsal  singing.. I'm planning to buy Bluetooth wireless headset of the same brand 'Boult' hope it meets my expectations ..P. S.  The headset wire has survived through my toddlers pull n play (hence the review now) , also lost my first ears bud ..realised it was good bcoz next size fitted my ears properly so please your earbud fit

Brought two Boult Audio BassBuds X1 in-Ear Wired Earphones on March 2021. Quality & build is good enough considering the price point. But one of them lasted till July-August 21 & another stopped  working around mid Octobor, 21. Though they are still in warranty period, you wouldn't want to got through the hectic process of mailing.

The sound quality at this point is just awesome. I earlier used skullcandy earphones which were priced around ₹1000 and this earphones beats them easily. The bass is awesome. At medium volume the earphones are loud enough that you can hear the music or voice calls clearly. You don't have to keep the volume high. The Kevlar coating on the wire earphones makes it feel solid and of good quality. So it won't get cut or stretch easily. The angles jack also make it easy to keep it in pocket and there is less chance of wear and tear. All in all if you are looking for a budget earphones with awesome quality then buy these pair of earphones blindly.

This is a great earphone for under 500rs. It's Bass is awesome and the extra ear pieces are also provided, this enhances the comfort but the only thing lacking is surround sound... This earphone is unable to give 3d sound... Otherwise great product!!!

Beautiful Tiny Packaging. Very long, thick wires which do not get tangled. Amazing build quality, lightweight, looks super premium. Sound is spot on. Great Balance between Treble and Bass. Very high sound volume. Mic works fine, crystal clear noise cancelled sound. Lesser problems on the other side too. Great buy, slightly overpriced for a brand like Boult in today's wired earphone market.

For the price I purchased this itme is great. Decent sound quality , good mic , and durability of the wire is better than expected. But unfortunately my dog have chewed it once and ruined nit forever. So one thing is clear. This product is not dog proof. But still worth it

I purchased a pair of wired earphones 2 months ago. Sound quality was great. Excellent noise cancellation and very comfortable fit. But the mic stopped working after 3 weeks. Extremely disappointed as it caused a lot of trouble. I contacted customer service who insist I courier it to them across the country.In the cost it takes to courier, I would rather get a new pair of earphones from a company like Boat who have excellent customer service and have a pick up and delivery service for their damaged products under warranty.If you care about the warranty and customer service. Do not purchase from Boult. Go for Boat or JBL instead.

Headphones last for about a year for me.  Mine is a functional use to take conf calls & google meets while working.  Posting this review after about 3 months of usage.The construction is robust.  Design of 3.5mm pin helps pushing into jack without worrying about stressing the wire.  Audio is clear without noise. The extensions in ear buds fits snugly & doesn't fall out while moving.  I rarely hear music in this earphone.  But it's not bad.  Value for money.  Feels like it will last longer.

Everything is just on point !Look , I am a very rough user,I was a little bit double minded at the time of purchase, build quality was my concern ,But boy oh boy its working like a charm !Now talking about sound, peak volume is nice , and most importantly this earphone has a smooth, rich kinda bass, so if you are lookin for boomy earphones, you may pass this one, but according to my taste and likings this is the USP of the product its just perfect ,Hige shoutout to the manufacturers !Writing this review after over 8 month of usage !

I bought this BOULT AUDIO BASSBUDS X1 Earphone as a replacement for my Boat Earphone. I mostly use this earphones for listing to music and will use them as a headset for my Pubg mobile game which is why I needed the one with a mic.I found great reviews on realme 1 buds. so, I thought newer version will also do justice & at a decent price so wanted to try them out.I am comparing them with my Boat EarphonesSound Quality:The sound quality is actually very good! I'm impressed by crisp and clean sound with good bass! They are not headphones but for earbuds, they are top of my list even better than my boat which I thought were amazing.You get a nice bass at all volume levels and at higher levels the quality is still great and crisp/clear.⚫ Durability:I can say that it's durable i used it for like 3 months and I am going to try and come back after a year or six months to do a follow up on how well they are!But it is durable as it comes with high quality braided cable, Mic/Volume control/3.5mm Jack all feel solid and durable.We will see how long they last from daily use as an part-time mobile gamer.Noise Cancellation: Buds are very soft & comfortable & fit very well n isolate outside noise. And gives you the freedom to use in crowded places as well.Overall under , these Earphones sounds GREAT! I hope to return in the future to update my review using them for 6 months

See, If you are someone who wants to buy an allrounder earphone then might be this once for you. I got this product at just Rs.299/- in Amazon's Lightening Deal. The sound quality of this earphones is awesome (cristal clear sound I would say). The Bass quality is not that good (but according to the price, its acceptable). The wire is also a good quality wire (tangel free too). Mic quality is pretty average (concern is that, it doesn't cut any background sound while calling or recording. So you should alone while calling/recording.Now, someone are saying in the review section that ""this earphones are very uncomfortable and you can't wear it more than 15-20 mins"". I want to say them that, company provides extra earplugs in the box so please use them. Put it according to your ear size.Here are the scores:-• Sound Quality.-  9/10. (lil detail of sounds are missing, but very little)• Bass Quality.- 8/10.• Wire Quality.- 9/10.• Mic Quality.- 7/10.• Noise Cancellation.- 9/10. (it reduces almost 60-70% noise of outside)• And make sure that you are getting 1 warranty too at this price. It's great. Isn't it?(Note: Make sure that this numbers are my honest opinion, it will be vary person-to-person).Now, there is a reason why I give 4 stars to the product. It is because, it would have been great if the mic placement was in-line. Over-all, Satisfied.

Best in this price category.Better than earphones costing Rs.500-600/-Noise cancellation is goodAudio quality is very good for listening to media.Mic is very good and clear for phone calls.Cons:Material used for earbuds could have been better as it irritates skin and needs to be more softer.It decreases the user experiences and cannot use for long time.

At this price range it's a deal although if the budget can increase upto 450 or 500 u can get a betterrrr oneThe packing was quite goodThe first look at the product was premium for this budget it wasn't any local wala look looked like a premium oneThe sound was above expectation it sounds really goodIt lacks bass so bass lovers go for other optionsThe build is okayishThe mic/call quality is goodBest in budget good brand with good looks with good sound qualityIf your price range is 300 go for it

Hi,Item ok type, does the intended work.Not too good.:( One main drawback is the mic position.Mic is positioned at the joint which is far away from mouth.So when you use it for calls, the other person can't hear you properly.You have to hold the mic close to your mouth using one of your hands.I purchased it purely for meetings and calls and its not serving my purpose.Anybody wants cheap and better earphones at low cost then go for it.Thanks for reading

First I have bought this & check for one day, but mic of earphone is not working, so I replaced with new one, which I get after 4-5 days & then the same issue happens with replaced product.

you can compare this too many earphones and I would still choose this over them. its got a great bass and is very durable with a metal finish and a long wire. I don't have any problems. and it doesn't offer active noice cancellation but it blocks out a reasonable amount of sound and is definitely worth the 400 rupees

If you want allrounder earphones which is best in class, go for these earphones,  This is my 1-year review of using these earphones,1) Strongest build quality- I squeezed and pulled these earphones too many times by mistake, then also there was no damage, it is very strong,2) Waterproof - I also used this in the rainy season under the rain and has been in my washing machine too many times, with no damage.3) Best sound quality - It has the best sound quality in its segment, I have bose earphones too but comparing it with it sounded pretty much similar.  Also, it has a 1-year warranty, what more do you want at this price ...Final conclusion: Trust me without any hesitation purchase it, you will love this product, it is worth every penny.

I really liked this product. As you can see in image, it has seal. I also got warranty card inside it. I have to register by scanning for 1 year warranty. Sound quality is awesome and best noise cancellation. I never got such a good noice cancellation feature within this price range. I have aslo used sennheiser earphones costing 1600 apprx. but noice cancellation is the best in this earphone. Best quality product for this price range. I am just loving it. Great grip and bass quality. Just go for this product.

This is worst product I have ever used .

I'll say this it's my 2nd time in 2 years that I have ordered the same product. The first one was the best product under 400₹ but 2nd time when I ordered it, everything is fine but man did the Boult team has lowered it's quality.  Yes the quality has gone down significantly, specially of the mic and the one button remote. Because of which I'm felling dissatisfied, BUT it is still one of 5he best products u could get for under 400₹. I'll maintain my stance.

Guys please refer 3 start reviews before buying anything, cos those will be the true facts about the product!! Product is good.I ordered blue but got black colour product,, why!

I have bought this after reading all the excellent reviews.  To be honest im very disappointed. The audio quality is very average. So does the bass.

Waste for calling or gaming. You can hear music only. I have replaced the headset for the same problem. Again the new headset also same problem.

One of the worst experiences so far purchasing on Amazon. Received a used, damaged product in a damaged case. It's all to do with the supplier than the product or Amazon. There should be a mechanism for Amazon to ensure the quality and penalize the suppliers for such intentional wrongdoings. Also the customers should be compensated for the time and efforts wasted in receiving such bad items.

Sound quality not good. After 2months of normal use problems started in earphone, jack gets deattached automatically, a parallel sound is audible during call thats very much weird and the best part is- warranty is fake. This company does'nt accepts item after 7days of use so no warrranty will be provided. I am very much disappointed with the product. An advice i will give, spend more get more, don't go with the cheap products. I modified my review after 2months of use as i reviewed this product after 1week of use. So buy wisely.

No response, requested them a pick up order which I was willing to pay , no proper response. Finally I purchased a another earphones , received new earphones the quality wasn't that good they might be giving out refurbished earphones , cuz the quality of earphones was noticable.

The sound is one of the worst i have ever heard. It sounds cheap and metallic. I have had other earphones of same price range with way better sound. It has some base but it is all metallic.

Def worth the price, tbh more that what you get on the price. I've been using the Boult earphones for nearly a month, and I've faced no issues whatsoever.The sound & the huild quality is upto the mark. I can say more than what you pay for this or the competitors.I can see that the company had genuinely put on work and are serious about their product.I've used several earphones in the past : Boat, Samsung, Philips, Apple etc. From that experience I can assure you that you won't regret buying this piece, i.e., Boult . If you're looking for a earphones for a price range of under 500, This is best.

It's been 2 months since I'm using this. I use it everyday and believed me it sounds amazing. I bought these after a lot of intense research and comparisons.Bass is just right, treble feels a bit off but not anything to complain about.I can confidently say that you will get far more worth for what you paid. It also feels and looks of good quality. Blindly go for it.

It's been 3 months since I'm using these Boult Audio earphones 🎧 and I had gone through a lot of earphones before these but I can surely say this is one of the best purchase I have ever made in this lockdown.Previously was using the original apple earphones and they actually had a problem of sound going low in one of the buds and they used to get entangled a lot. In emergency I had to first sit and straighten them but with these earphones I have never faced a problem of them being entangled.The sound quality and volume are great as with 30% of volume I'm able to enjoy the sound better than what I had in the apple one's with 80%. I'm a audiophile so I tested out these with all different type of music. These are good as well for casual gaming sessions.Just one thing the mic is at a lower position so sometimes it has to be taken near to mouth while on calls other than that the mic quality is also quite good. I have taken sessions as a speaker with 500+ attendees using these earphones and the audio quality was good.Bass - GreatSound Clarity - GreatVolume Level - Excellent

This review is after using week.Things i liked:a.  buit quality is better than all other in tjis price segment. I have used boat, and other 2 brands.b. Length of wire, nearly a meter.SOUND QUALITY, its loud and noise cancellation is good, mic is perfect.Bass is just good, but at times it feels more treble.Overall its good. Price-worthy. Go for blind buy, you wont be disppointed.

I dislike because it has just one good thing which is sound , but you will able to hear the sound when it will get connected to your phone . Second it has a mic of poor quality, you have to disconnect the earphone you the other person on call can hear your voice, other wise he/she will just hear noises.This issue will arise early or with 6 months , so don't buy it.I love the boat earphone they are expensive than this but no issue of connectivity and mic.

First of all thanks to Amazon for its fast delivery... I got the product within one day....So thanks for that...Now let's talk about the product,The sound quality is really good, before buying this product I also read other people's reviews some are saying its good and some are saying its bad.... I have been confused that should I buy this or should I prefer other....But After buying and testing them This earphone are good...It has deep bass and little bit of noise cancellation and also the treble is good.And it also has the single button control (1-click for play and pause and for answering and ending calls, 2-click for next song,and 3-click for previous song) and microphone for calling....over all If you are thinking to buy this earphone at this price point of (rs368) I would recommend that you should try this....Build quality - 8/10Bass - 9/10Treble - 9/10Noice cancellation - 8/10Over all I will give 8.5/10I am not giving 9/10 because I have noticed one thing that In full volume sometimes in some songs the treble get frade a little bit....So that it...But It is a good product I would say.....

sound quality of the earphones is perfect , they are very good for play free firen, even i also used that for free fire and you can get the exact idea of the enemy location.But after 4 mothns of purchasing they become dead , that was a disappointment for me , because the price mention on the box is 999 rs and i get it @ 399  it was a great deal for such a product but alteast 1 year should need to work properly, and of you want to repair that then you need to sent them to their service center and there is no pickup by their side you need to sent by own and it can cost 100rs that is not a good thing , when i come to know for repair i need to send them the earphones by my own and need to spend other 100rs.  then i kill that earphines completely and i am not happy by the after sales services, from a big brand BOULT with brand ambassdor like KIARA  and VICKY KAUSHAL

The sound is decent and the bass is also good. Well i dont like too much base but this earphone has a decent bass which is good for me. Noise cancellation is good. Build quality is very good. Wire feels strong and earphone is Metal so they are also strong. But there is one big problem this earphones are not at all comfortable, my ears start paining after half an hour of use they feel heavy in ear beacuse they are made of metal. Overall a good product but not so comfortable.

I bought this product and returned it after checking its mic quality.  Its not up to the mark, even if u put somewhat near to mouth its not catching the voice, unless ita very very near to mouth.  (only mic is problem, sound is good)

I was searching for a wired earphone  for quite a long time. Browsed  through  internet and then came across this pair. Saw majority reviews of this one positive therefore went for it. And guess what, it's  just as good as it could be! Everything  about this earphone is so balanced and awesome,  be it bass, vocals, trebles or anything. It gets as loud as it could  be without the distortion of the sound even at the maximum volume. It sits snugly and comfortably  in the ears as well. And you know what's the cherry (🍒) on  the cake (🎂)?! I got it for 299/- during a lightning deal in amazon. So happy to get this. You may want to comsider this:)

 I have received this earphone two times. once in replacement.Both earphones has same problem (microphone problem).1st earphone's microphone didn't work and second one earphone's microphone produces too much noise.Perhaps it may even be the manufacture defect.Because same earphone is my friend's also used his earphone is too good.I had ordered only after seeing my friend's earphone. But I did not get good, twice times

If your budget is between 300 to 350, this earphones are best..for sure...bcz I don't know any other company who gives you 1 year warranty at this range ..for this quility sound, bass ..this earphones have good bass ..i don't like more bass but..you can surely adjust sound trebele, bass and mid in earphones setting in music app..so i recommend go for it...but I'm writing this review based on sound quality,look and build quality after received in just 15 min...so i don't have any experience of using it long time ..and also not sure about warranty service...so check others feedbacks.

It is working good for a few months, suddenly it stopped working. As per my observation for a while there is a audio disturbence while using the earphone and the audio quality is not so great. It worked me around 6 months then it stopped suddenly there is no external damage, I think quality is poor that might be the reason for the life of the earphone.

The sound quality of this product is really good. Bass quality is good for the price. Ear loops given helps the earphones not to fall off from the ears. Comfortable to wear for longer hours as well. Angled jack makes the produt durable. Best product for the price.

I have no words to say.Even if was confused Wether to buy this earphones or go for boat bass buds 225. I just ordered both. Believe me the sound quality of both are almost 90% same. These earphones' bass, treble, highs and lows are just as of boat. ( but u get a bit more *just a bit more* bass in those boat earphones). U get the same contents as of boat bass buds 225 in the pack. This is just like a grab on deal at just 299/-. Where as boat costs 250/- more than this at 549/-.Overall if u want those striking colored earphones then go for boat bass buds 225. And if u are not really worried about ""somewhat flashing contrasts ""  then go for boult. I would insist u to buy boult rather than boat,  Keeping all the necessary requirements in mind.

Not recommended at all.Problem with its connector pin.Lose connections are made at connector which irritates you all time.Had returned it twice by assuming the quality problem with received unit but same was the problem with second piece.Amazon returned the fund.

As per sound quality is concerned, best headphones in this range. Good bass, good surround feel. Absolutely loved it. But when it came to mic function. No at all good. Mic didn't worked. I replaced the headphones but still no go. Finally I had to ask for refund as primarily I was looking for mic. If only looking to hear music. Can be thought of buying

For few days, it worked perfect and I thought it is a good product. however after 5 months it is stopped working one side and after one more month it stopped working other side too, since the product is under warranty, I contacted the customer support and they asking me to send the product to Delhi. I purchased this at 349 Rs, if i want to send this to Delhi from my place then it will cost me another 100 rs. now I am thinking why would not I spend another 100+ rs  when i was purchasing this product. Simply these people ask us to send through the courier because the customer will not send this by spending extra money....

Sound quality is awesome, bass and noise cancellation is good.

Every thing is fine but the two small horns to fit in ear muscle is paining.Tilted model jack is good innovation to avoid wire breaking while winding up often.Sound quality is fine,used better quality rubber around the magnets.So less problem during current leakage from nearby devices.

Pleasantly surprised by the audio quality here. Its just way better for this price. Much better than every headphone/earphone I own below 2.5K price.  Only issue I see is with the cable quality which is thin. Will get to know if it will last long. I intend to use these for running.

 The bass was surprisingly good. This has better bass than most earphones under Rs.1000.The sound is pretty clear and balanced. Noise cancellation isn't the best, but considering the product costs less than Rs.300, it surely lives upto it's expectations.Honestly, if this product was listed at Rs.500-600, it would've been a fair deal at that price point too.

I was first thinking to buy Boat100 but then I saw Boult X1, it's good-looking and you will be impressed by it just by a glance! Then I had read the reviews and ques-ans, it was going well. I had thought that why buy Boat 100? Boult X1 has ear-hooks, a golden audio jack, attractive colour,etc. And so i was extremely delighted when I ordered, I was eagerly waiting for the delivery. but when I received it and tested its sound, I was shocked. The sound is too bad that I can't explain! 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗕𝗼𝘂𝗹𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝘆? I began to think that I've been trapped by look, If you want  look for show-off then go for it. But if you want the sound quality then believe me BoAt 100 is a better option! And now, I can't return it, I should have bought BoAt 100! 😭

I bought this earphone for mainly talking on calls,the mic quility is pretty good,I read one review where someone said that the mic was placed ""awkwardly"" and not near the mouth,but after using these earphones for more than 2 months,I can say that there's no need to hold the mic near your mouth,you can just talk and the other person on the call would be able to hear you clearly,and if u wanna hear music,then the bass and noise cancellation is very good too,these earphones have been very working nicely for me.

I never thought this great sound quality experience in low budget.. earphone before. Amazing sound clearity with good bass equaliser and also microphone quality (mic) amazing and clear.at a low cost But I just found out that you can't get a one-year warranty. If your product is not physically damaged, you will be unable to obtain a replacement. There is no customer service number. The one-year warranty is only for the name.

Sound quality is quite good for the price. But I really regret buying this product as it has no comfort at all. You can't even wear these earphones for more than 30 mins. It's speakerheads are very big and weirdly shaped that the insides of your ears hurt if you wear it for too long. I had to take around 5 breaks to watch a 2 hour movie to comfort my ears.

Cheap but waste of money. Just cannot use for phone calls, as the other party cannot hear, microphone is not good.There is a constant ticking noise when the earphone is plugged to mobile/computer and it is quite disturbing.I wouldn't suggest anyone to buy this.

These earphones are quite good. The bass is strong, over all build quality is also good. This is value for money. In the first order I received the earphones with a damaged microphone. So I requested for a replacement and then received the Earphones with properly working microphone. It costs 349 Rs. At Boult website, while 400 (399) at Amazon. However you would have to pay 40 rs for delivery. So it reaches the same amount as on boult. Now the price on Amazon for this product has increased.

Need to improve bass quality as per the price and if not then they should drop the price of these ear phones .

I recommend you not to buy this if you want it for both music and calling. if you want just for music you can go for it. Bought this product and within a month its mic stops working properly and creating unwanted noise during calling. And when I asked for replace of product they told me to send the defective product at said address and told me to pay for the shipping charges which is ridiculous as the given product has 1 year warranty. It's better to buy earphone from local shop in this range atleast you can replace them without paying any extra charges.

Within 20days of buying this earphone. It stopped working from one side. It has loose connection from the 3.5mm jack. I wrote a mail to the company for the replacement of the product. But it has been 15days no reply from the company.

Exceptional bass response out of the box. So it required a breakin period of one week with different frequencies to widen the sound stage. The built in mic needed nearly 2 hours of breakin to grasp the vocals to the optimum level. After one week of usage with different music genre and calls the headphones drivers and built in circuitry acquired its next level of integration and performing well than the factory integration. Hardware wise the tangle free cable and 3.5 mm jack is of exceptional quality considering it’s selling price. In fact a good try for the audio enthusiasts..
"

sound quality is good, bass is balanced, not dominant, so think what you like.another good thing is each earphone is dedicated to one ear. so the right will go in right ear and left in left. this helps cz, then you can get the surround sound effect right.the rubber bands won't always fit in ears, one can take those off though.it few times wont connect to my smartphone if put fast inside. needs to  be done slowly, idk why? but that may not be the case for all of them.
"
5344,"
Sound quality is pretty ok considering the price. The trebles, mid and high tones are also appreciably good. Sound is aslo crispy. But the main thing is the bass. IT HAS NO BASS, or I would say bass is in  NEGLIGIBLE amount. If you are looking for an earphone which has great trebles, if bass doesn't bother you much and if you are a bit tight on your budget then you can surely give a look at this one. But if you are a bass lover, if you listen bass heavy music then you might look for some other earphones. Thnx for reading and spending your valuable time on this...

Build quality and design is unexpected in this range of price. They provided three sets of different size earphone bud and ear supports.Bass quality is not bad. Cant get the treable.Ear comfort is good, i used it for more than 2 hours without any discomfort. U cant feel the weight of earphone beacuse of ear support.They mention noice cancellation is there but trust me if you goes to use it for calls only most then dont go for it. Noice cancellation is not working even 1%.tangle free also a big lie. Its thin cylidrical wire and spiral itself and tangling.

Cons:-Plastic area of both buds gets loose and moves freely after some months like 3-4.Wire quality is not that great and tangles alot.L-shape jack is not that useful and still wire breaks from the end after 6-7 months.Pros :-80% value for money,Everything is Balanced except bassGood ear fittingNoise cancellation is good @ 70% volumeNo pain in ears after long continuous usage

Treble is good , bass in not deep it's like boot cut ,, can't adjust much with equalizers. Clarity is good , wires looks ok even though jack is bit delicate. Earphone fit is ok. If u r a serious listener don't go for it. Ok for basic plus listeners.

The sound quality is clear and crisp. The higher is very good due to neodymium drivers and also as it boasts it has a good base. Noise cancellation is surely not one of its qualities. The buds provides are an average quality.The problem is that after 6 months , one side of the earphone goes off.It has happened to me twice with two different pairs of boult audio earphones within the same price range.I think the product is really good. But if you are looking for durability and long life, I am sorry but this shouldn't be your choice at all.

Where to start with first comes first I have honestly been needing good quality earphones real bad.So,I deliberately starting literally hunting for it on Amazon and Then I came across these bass babies with optimal budget friendly Deal.Then, I looked onto what it would provide and that got me awestruck seeing the price tag again.The sound quality is ambiently insane and amazing you can jaw droppingly hear the woofers thumping beats through that in ear feel you get.Its a typical Car Jam feeling which is astoundingly amazing.Its 10mm Drivers are driving Me crazy still and its HD Deep Bass and 3D accoustics are next level .So If you are looking for a perfect wired earphones and you are a go to music person to the crux of your motivation.These bass babies are worth a try at this pocket friendly deal.

The microphone of the product stopped working properly after 15 days of usage. I have logged a call and have been told to courier the product back to Delhi.

Will not make it a lengthy one, just point wise;Sound - Good sound, will not regret be it listening to songs or watching a movie. Dialogues are clear and sound effects are goodOverall for sound 👍Bass quality - I am not a bass lover, so for me the bass is okOverall for bass quality 😌Noise Cancellation- Have not tried it outdoors yet, however call experience is great, no issue's.Overall 👍Comfort - well here I am a little dissatisfied as it starts ear pain after 30-45 minutes of usage. Have to adjust repeatedly to avoid ear pain.Overall for comfort 👎Durability - Durable product in first look, have been using it for 4-5 days only, so can't tell you more as of now..

The mic glitches sometimes, be warned they have a terrible after sales service they won't pick up your calls or they will answer your e-mail but it's a bad thing that they don't have service center's in city you have to send you products to them if they are faulty and pay it from your pocket I'll suggest get a better one at that price point that has a service center in your city.

This earphones sounds so amazing!! It have bass and also have treble!! This is the first earphones I listened to in which there is both bass and treble. But there is one problem regarding comfortablity, and that is that whenever I use the locking buds, it feels heavy, so I have to remove them. So, I'm not going to use those locking earbuds 'cause it simply doesn't feels comfortable. Without locking earbuds it is average comfortablity.
"

The earphones delivers on performance & maintains the balance between treble and bass. Hence, it’s kind of neutral and delivers the notes in the audio range clearly. its a good choice when one is watching a movie/ documentary etc & is subjecting himself to long hours on earphone. Totally satisfied with the product.

The product built quality is very cheap and it breaks in a week, fortunately it was under replacement.

I have bought this earphone on July 29th.After one and half month I am writing this review.Pros: this earphone is comparatively good than Boat. This earphone has the ear holder which provides flexibility to hold this earphone better than boat basic.2. The jack which goes to cellphone is very intelligently designed in such a way that I do not have to remove cellphone cover.3.  At this Price range I would tell it is better than boat due to its holding grip on ear.4. Decent sound quality as it does not make pitch high and does not become irritating for increasing sound.Cons:1.  This ear phone wire is round rather than flat. However this is not a cons but need to handle with care.  Boat has flat wire high gives more robust.

I have been using Boult X1 since a year. Decent headphones for a surperb price with moderate noise isolation an good for games/music. After 4 months they stopped working,however I contacted boult and they replaced my headphones with no extra cost. Since then was happy, but then they got stolen. Ordered this red pair. Very pretty. I received a damaged product , raised a ticket and got replacement within two days. It's a hassle but they're worth it. Also do register your product for warranty. One year replacement warranty!!!!!

This is a beast for Rs 400. For listening to songs onlyNothing I guess comes closer to beat this at such priceExcellent BASS, sound for songs etc is awesomeStability n comfort is great, and doesn't pain in ears even after using for 4-6hrs continuously.So the earphones won't fall off.Wish trebble was balanced. But these days all earphones seem to only care about BASS.If you are looking to use this for office calls due to wfh, will not suggest this then since the bass is high, many times you won't hear words clearly.Use something which is more of a sterio or hd or medium bass earphones then

This is the best product in this segment.  . I am really amazed with this product. .Pros1. Good sound quality2. Bass and treble are accurate .  Infact better than the boat bassheads 225 ,which i was previously using .3. Wire is tangle free .4. You can get extra earbuds in it.5. Gold platted jack, so it doesn't corrode easilyCons1.  It doesn't feel premium2. U can't listen the songs on high volume, it becomes noisy and may cause earpain .. . So i would suggest change the earbuds . .if the normal earbuds are causing a problem . . You can use large size earbuds which are present on the box . It will solve your problem3 . Surround sound is not so good, only for music lovers not for gaming lovers . Verdict:If you love to listen music then go for it .if you want to purchase a earphone for gaming in this segment ,go for boat bassheads 225 .

Hey, i was using boat rockerz 450 headphones before (those are awesome) and this is my first experinece of these type of earphones.But acc. to my experience>bass is up to mark>treble is okay, not so high not so low>sorry I am having no knowledge of voice cancelation.-ve point : only one in lined button and no voice controller only can be done by mobilei got to ear buds and those curved shaped soft ANTI SLIP HOOKSand i used it for online classes and music and my experiene is good.

Very nice sound and build quality of the product ...I purchased from Amazon delivery is fast and the Boult headphones quality is very amazing and happy with the fit in ear not get fall down...also they called me for write a review and will give cashback so little disappointed by this yet not received cashback of this product

I have bought two of them and The Boult earphones are just awesome. Sound quality is EXCELLENT along with that the Bass and Noise cancellation functions are very well balanced for giving us an excellent hearing environment.After wearing its just gives theatre experience which is much needed for watching movies or playing games.Also its 3.5mm jack has curved wire for good holding and does not cause any damage to the wire as it did in some straight pin earphones.Microphone also gives good audio output. I tried recording songs and it was nice.All over its the best product in this price range.

I'll give my honest review....the earphones are amazing. The sound is crystal clear and bass is woooww. If i compare it with most popular earphones in budget segment i.e...The Realme buds 2 which are also very amazing but i would like to say that these are very great earphones at this prize as compared to the Realme buds 2. No doubt the bass is very good but the mids, vocals and all other aspects are also great. I'm not saying that Realme Buds 2 are not good but if you want more cheaper and good quality earphones, then its a great choice to buy these earphones without any doubt.The cable is also very strong and durable and the most important thing that is the earphones are of aluminium which gives it a feel of premiumness.At last i would like to say just go for it if you are music lover.

this is my 2nd product from the boult.. before i had the Bluetooth one even that was not up to the mark.. and recently i had brought the wired earphones and at the first day itself the mike was not even functioning properly as there were lots of disturbances while on call... I suggest everyone that not to go for this product...
"

Well, I must say 'this headphone is awesome. Really loved it. Too good. Brilliant staff... Got all the staff...Bass: Perfectly up to mark...Noise cancellation: Could have been little better. 4.5/5.Value for money: No doubt...

I bought this earphone. Mostly I used headphone during traveling for listening music and watching videos. After one months of usage this headphone, I am giving review.I got the product well packed by Amazon.After Sale service is awesome.Built quality is great.Sound is good.Bass is just awesome.Loved this earphone.Wires are sturdy and strong.Guys go for it.Unique productBetter pricing of all.

Sound quality is good and well. No downside. But in terms of built quality, something should be changed. The mic area is very lengthy ,which makes inconvenience while talking. It's too far from mouth. Also both the ear piece are same length which also cause inconvenience when hold in neck. Unable to use the left side wire around the neck.

Here is the review after 6 months of usePros:1.Best build quality even under price range of 500rs2.Best mic and relatively better wire length3.Best fit in ears4.Good for music and office calls-------------------------------------------------------------Cons:1.Not much I was expected volume controls

I have tried multiple earphones but don’t know why always face noise issue with all of those earphones but then I ordered these Boult ones and I used these and I have not experienced any noise issue during any call and video and more of that it’s bass is also very good.It comes with extra pair of rubbers also and easily fits into the ear.Like this product and well recommended.
"

It lasted me for a very long time. The sound quality was decent enough for the price. But the ear canal tip is little hard so I removed it because it caused me pain. You would get 80% noise cancellation like you could understand if something is happening around you but you would not be able to understand what's going on because you can't identify the external sounds.

I got this for 299.It was delivered in two days I have prime account.Pros:Bass is good.The earphones correctly suits in my ears.They provide earbuds and the one which holds the earbuds.Noise cancellation is good.I recommend buying this.This product has 1 year warrant you can register online.Great buyCons:The packing was not good. The box it came was crushed.Luckily it wasn't damaged.The wire is thin. Be careful with that.Thank you.Edit: After 30 daysI used it for 30 days and one of the ear is not working. Don't buy it.

First things first, I was literally mesmerized by its bass.

It's been 3 months now I'm using this earphone and here are my honest reviews.Sound quality is still the same.Great bass.Great noise cancellation.Very handy.Light weight so that you won't feel any ear disturbance.Mic quality is also good till now.They have provided some additional buds also in mainly three different sizes.I have used many other earphones both wired and wireless and honestly nothing can match when it comes to boult, be its quality or price.Really good brand.It's just that I feel the wires used can be made of a more strong material.Ignore the gluing that I have done on the earphones. I use it very roughly and that's why I glued it so that it doesn't break.So yeah it's a really good product for people who are looking for earphone in the range around 400-500.
"
5390,"
Do not buy it even it is having good sound quality but get stopped working after 2 months.When complained to Boult , they are saying , raise complaint to website, then parcel your item to Our warehouse, which cost will need to bear by me.When you know it is not working why don't you replace simply.. straight thing is that do not buy it for a bad experience.
"
5391,"
Right bud of earphone has stopped working just after 10 days of delivery. Since return period was 7 days, hence I can't return it. I contacted Boult. They've asked me to personally courier is to their workshop after 15 days which is a spend that I will have to bear.I would recommend to give this a miss.
"
5392,"
Don't buy this product trust me.After one month used-Sound is average because whenever i try increase volume,pitch also increases with volume. then ear going to in trouble with pain. And their is no place for bass😂. So don't waste your money with this cheap product. Samsung original white earphone (250 rs) is better than this product. If you have 500-600 rs budget for earphone try ANT AUDIO W56. that's all

At first build quality is good with premium look and feel. However still prefer one with magnets.Now coming to main aspect, sound quality is good with extraordinary bass.It is comfortable to wear but wire get tangled very often therefore go for magnet one.

Don't go for it, not working properly within a month. when I claimed they where asking me to send product by courier, for same I need to pay. courier cost will be the half of product cost. is it really a good company? please do not go for this brand in any time. really worst experience.This people where selling there wrong products and making people fool, please please do not go for it.

The SOUND QUALITY of this earphones are quite impressive considering price the sound crisp and clear although it sometimes gets unbalanced but rest is good, The BASS QUALITY of this earphones are very good you'll love it's NOISE CANCELLATION is also good however you had to put right type of earbuds to them and company actually provides those extra ear buds with different sizes which is very good at the price . They are best earphones is their price segment Don't think just buy it you'll love it.
"
5397,"
At this price point this earphones tops the list. It has a decent and sturdy build quality. The earpiece is AL alloy whcih assures longetivity and gives a really nice acoustics. For a budget earphones the sound is surprisingly cystal clear. The built in mic and in-line control to answer/reject/ calls, play/pause and voice command is a plus. The 3.5 mm jack is slightly angled so that using it on sides of laptop wont bend the wires, which is really nice. They also provide with two extra different sized ear buds and ear fins.Overall, you get bang for your buck.

This headset has surprisingly great sound quality at such a low price. The sound is crystal clear, vocals and treble are excellent. The bass is also good, it is not low, but the earphones is not recommendable for those who are bass lovers as this headsets tend to focus more on the overall sound quality and has a balanced output. The quality of the wire is decent. The red colour headset looks gorgeous. I previously owned a Sennheiser CX 213 which is priced more than double of this headset. It has sound quality as good as CX 213, a better bass and it also provides a microphone which is good, which CX 213 lacked and a better build quality

If you had purchased this model last year from Amazon, you would be familiar with the premium design and feel the it offered compared to this year. After receiving the same model this year, there is a clear decline in quality (i.e., thickness of the wire, material used for the mic, and overall listening experience). The packaging has also been downgraded in terms of visual appeal.In 2020, the build and sound quality of this model was the best I've used in the 'under 500Rs' range. I hope things change for the best.

I am very disappointed by buying this product.Actually, Boult audio having a great impression on me as I buyed same Boult bassbuds X1 in 2019 I was amazed by the first impression of the earphone. The bass was (oh! my god) build quality was also impressive and gives premium feel.I am also prefering my friends to switch to the Boult audio.But now im am fully disappointed by buying boult bassbuds X1 because these looks cheep, sound quality is also not as much as I founded in previous one.bass quality is shit!Thank you...

It's getting disconnected automatically and not connecting at all. You've to do that manually once again. Apart from the disconnection issue, its a good one at this price.You might feel the overall sound is very less, but after listening the songs for a while, you'll feel it's enough.Edit:I've ordered replacement and so far it's working fine without any disconnections and having same quality. I'll update here once again after using this for couple of days.

i am using this one after having sennheiser cx 180 street || and cx 275 and few other sony mdr series as well as philips one and one of my old Sony Ericsson earphones, i guess for the price it is selling this one puts in the very good spot for price to quality / performance ratings.it is somewhat came close to one of my past earphones in terms of sound in major parts , not all. but hey it's only 3/4 of the 1/4 of the price to what that other brand is selling so,i'm really happy with the purchase. i wanted to try new just once and i guess i chose well.:D

I was actually surprised to find that you could get good sound quality for 300 bucks. If this product turns out to be durable (more than 6 months)...i would say this is worth the purchase.Coming to sound quality, i would say its good as in OK. Dont expect anything crisp or great, but its good. Sometimes the bass supresses all the other sounds for an instance which is a little annoying.Noise cancellation is good.Talking about comfort...its OK for short time but for long time use...its not so good.
"
5411,"
If you want it only for listening music then it is best, but spending around 300rs and not able to use mic then it's not worth.I replaced original product thinking after replacement new earphones mic will be working but it is not working even now. So don't waste money.

Loved it a lot! For its price, it has a much better sound and build quality. Noise cancellation is sufficient. Its minimum volume is slightly on the lower side, which is highly comfortable for calling purposes (My previous Boat earphones were loud, and I had to loosely wear them while making a call, or while being kept on hold). These earphones are perfect for me

The product is worth the price. Noise Cancellation is brilliant and excellent sound quality. Apart from that, I love the style as well. At first, it was difficult to fit in ears due to the design, but once you are comfortable, it is amazing.Edit: After ten months of use, it stopped working and when contacted the customer care, they said to courier the damaged product. Since it is not feasible for me (could buy a new one with the courier charge) I haven't returned. But I expected product to be a little bit durable due to the brand name and price.

The product is not good at allAnd in this price Point you should prefer well known brands. Its net went inside the earphoneThere packing was worst the Wire quality was good but audio quality was not satisfactory at this price we expect more from unknown brands but I Must suggest some well known brands earphones its bass was not also so good as the name is. Honestly it deserves 1 star out of 10 .

I actually bought this earphone on the 27th August 2020! Talking about sound, noice cancellation and bass quality it is a superb quality for this price point. Howver there is always downsides, now it's 28th September 2020 after one month it suddenly stopped working so I had to hold the Jack connection to get the sound. I'm pretty disappointed with its durability and liftime, else I would give 5 stars. Since it doesn't even last for two months I give 2 stars!

I would suggest everyone to check out the Driver size they use in earphones and this is only for Music Enthusiasts.

Previously I was not a BOULT user but after I purchased it I am in love with them. I thought they would be a normal earphones which also come free when we purchase a smartphone. But these are much and much better from the normal earphones. Also its speciality is that the curved thing which is made up of rubber at the tip is very useful. Because of it the earphones fit perfectly in my ears. Thank you BOULT AUDIO for providing such a nice product for such a low price. So don't even think for a second and just buy it

These boult bassheads are an absolute steal for this price.I mainly purchased it for the mic and music,as it's closer unlike many other earphones and it's fulfilled it's purpose.They have a sporty look and a plastic build.The audio quality is outstanding ,and this is by far the best earphones I've had till now.The bass is well.They're great for my workouts and sweatproof.Call quality is great and I've had no complains so far.Overall very satisfied with my purchase.Its sporty look might not be for everyone but performance wise it's great.

As to how this product works, it does what it says quite well. I cannot speak for its reliability because I'm only a few days into it's use. I've seen reviews where people have said they've received fake product and they seem to have pictures to prove it. I have received what I believe the genuine article.That said, the QR code on the warranty card doesn't work, but you can register the product on their website manually, after which what I believe to be the customer-care have followed up on it after the initial registration of said warranty.

Not user friendly. Cable gets annoying and is difficult to use while walking. They should at least provide a clip to ensure it stays in place.

The product in general is good. Sound quality is great, comfortable to wear. However there seem to be an issue with the mic.

Anyways now it serves my purpose of listening to music.

Good quality earphones for the price. The bass is nice and adds a little extra to the songs you are listening to, if you are into rock. Bollywood songs sometimes seem too bass-y and not in a good way. At full volume, there is some cracking and the sound is tinny but it’s ok for most songs and you can’t really expect more from a product priced in the value range. Overall I would purchase the product again, especially since I lose earphones often and the combination of sound quality, wearing comfort and price make this a good buy.P.S. came to know of X2 after I had ordered these so maybe next time will try those

I was already impressed by others review, they make me happy to buy this product.This is such good looking earphone with great features and highlights such as you can get Deep Bass, Micro woofers, function Button. It has also slightly L shaped 3.5mm connector jack which feels absolutely good while Playing games, watching movies. You can put this Earphone in your ear  upto 2-3 Hrs after that you will be getting some pain as I get.At last Boult Audio is also good in their field, they also thinks about their Customers.

One year ago i ordered similar products which was amazing in quality and performance and two months before it stop working so i decided to buy the same exact product again because of it's quality and value for money..... Surprisingly the product design is completely changed and new product is no where near to the old one.. The mic position is changed to spliters and it is annoying mic sucks.... After one month of use the product stop working so decide to write a review which is helpful to others who might look for the product the good reviews are based on old products new batch of product is utter waste

Sound is crisp and clear with nice bass. It's a bang for the buck. But the button is very hard to click sometimes that it it doesn't take any commands. After few months, the mic isn't working. And it is a long process to claim the warranty.

The first hand experience of using this product for few days is great. The sound quality is good. The bass and treble is decent given the price. I use this for my daily office work and meetings. The mic also performs well.They earbuds are more on a stiffer side but can be used for few hours without any pain.No major issues found till now.Compared to jbl priced at apprx 600/- this boult product gives a better deal at less price.Also this easily replaces the Mi earphones at this price point.Packaging amd delivery was fine.

Build quality is good.. Good sound quality in good price -  This is my Genuine reviewSomebody is calling the customer and asking to give a good rating to the product and send the screenshot and we will get 100\- credited to our Paytm Account.THIS IS FAKE.  this is just to get good rating to their products.

Generally i never write reviews, but buying this got me to write one because I don't want anyone else to fall for the cheap price and compromise on all aspects of a earphone.The sound is okayish, no bass no treble. The Mic does not work untill you hold it near your mouth. I would advice you not to buy these earphones and go for Ambrane Stringz 38 in the same price range.

Absolutely terrible product. The mic does not work at all in this model. And on top of that everytime we want to connect the earphoes with our phone, we have to use the button. That Is so astonishing that Boult have managed to screw up the product so bad that the basic things in this does not work at all. So nobody would give a blink if the earphones have the best bas in the work. would not recommend this company products to anyone.

It has a smooth metallic finish with ear loop along with various earbuds which offers a perfect fit to every ear. It can be used in various activities like gym, cycling as its water resistant.

I am loving these earphones. Purchased as a temporary replacement for my Headphones but now I prefer using these. As claimed by Boult the 10mm Driver Bass is really great. At higher volumes, we can find some distortion in audio. But this is expected at the price and also you are not using these at much higher volumes, so it doesn't matter. Overall Experience is very good. The hooks (or whatever it is called) make these stay in your ears during workout sessions. Also, I would prefer blue color ones over black or grey😉.

Not recommended to buy. During the call the sound quality is not good but if you like only music to listen you can buy it. No return option is available after buy you can only replace it. Mic button is on left which is very difficult to press the switch.

Overall an amazing buy. Top pros and cons after a  month's usage.Pros:1. Great sound quality2. Clear audio - vocals3. Sturdy built4. Good mic quality (calling is seamless)Cons:The only con is that Bass is a little low (Not very low but for ones looking for high bass, better drop this one. Great for regular use).

I would suggest you to go for a better alternative brand since my left ear stings when I place earbuds. When I replaced it with extra earbud that was provided with the package, it was alright. However, products are not perfect when you buy with Amazon. Some or the other problem persists, always. As compared to JBL or seinheiser, sound quality lacks a sense of pure flow if you know what I mean. Just like breathing fresh air, it lacks classy and superior sound quality that JBL or seinheiser provides. I have used both in the past. It's just alright but not that fantastic.

Boult bassbuds X1 is a perfect choice if you're looking for a good quality audio with great bass at a low price. These earphones are pocket friendly. The ergonomic design fits in your ear and doesn't let you worry about them coming out. The build quality is nice and the cable quality is also good. I had a doubt whether the product could meet its specifications at the price at which it is available but it's beyond good. The sound quality is immersive, the bass quality is good, the noice cancellation is great. Best choice for the people who need to listen to music while they work. Go for it.

I have used many earphones in the past, but nothing beats the quality of Boult Audio Bass Buds. It simply fits well, sounds good and is sturdy. I used it mostly for my long runs, and find it pretty much comfortable. I would recommend this product for anyone who wants to buy a wired earphone.

The earphones are pretty good in design and colour but the extra part would hurt my ears if I use it for a long so I just didn't liked it , since it was removable I removed it and apart from that it's cool and when I play games I should bring the Mike close when I'm talking or else team mates won't hear and this doesn't happen when I'm on a call . Idk what exactly is the problem.

I'm giving this review after using one month.Pro's :Light weight,  tangle free,  good bass,  mic quality is superb, ample length,  smart and sexy design,  good control, sweat proof, ear buds design dont make slip of earphone, eventhough you are in rush or in sleep.Con's :Mic shall be little closer as the length of wire is bit longer that whenever need to use mic,  we always have to hold near mouth even during meetings.Can't able to use more than 30 mins,  as ears starts paining.  That part shall be improved.

So I have been writing this review after using the product for almost 3 months and it's still sound crisp as it use to sound on day one, the build quality is excellent too as it survived my regular wear and tear. I have used some other products before this and they don't work this long but with Boult X1 I have to say it's worth every penny. I usually used it for calls and music purpose only can't say anything about gaming.To sum it up go for it if you are tired buying earphone every month and want something that have good sound go for it.

Pros*Audio quality is very impressive for the price (got for 399)*durability looks good as fewer weak points*good microphone quality*comfortable and good fit, doesn't come out while running, three sizes of ear buds and silicone 'hooks'Cons:*not braided*short cable*no volume controlWill update later if I find more.

Earphones are good, the sound is clear and looking at the price range, can't complain. The bass is nice and got a thump in it. If you are looking a budget earphones, these are the ones. Before this I used mi basics that were awesome but this is also a good choice. Didn't find h huge difference between both but this look quite awesome. I must mention about the fitting, it is good but the rubber fings are little hard that may be itchy at times rest all is good.

Received on time. Good packing. With  3 pairs of earbuds and supporting fins, you can find your fit. NC and bass is good, but not great. I can't expect more for Rs. 299.00.

If you are looking for special music experience, go for a more expensive and better branch.

This earphones are best in this price point.Sound quality is just so good in lows mids highs also. The passive noice cancellation is very good according to price. And the main thing that l like are its looks and comfort. These are the most comfortable earphones under 500. Believe me l have used about 7 pairs of earphones under 600 rs. These are at place 2. Just because the 1st place once are about 599 rs. But these are the best if you are finding a good earphones 🎧. The best part is the experience with Boult. Just go for it under349rs.

Lately, I was using Sony's XB 550 AP headphones, which are too good in each and every aspects. But, the thing is that they are big heads so i was looking for earphones. When i got this product and I compared it with my heads, my heads are far ahead in terms of sound quality, bass, clarity and all... But keeping in mind that they are ₹3200 headphones and this one are just ₹350, this earphones are too good. Though they are little uncomfortable, but that's not a big deal. This earphones are a good deal for ₹350.

I purchased this product as my little ones managed to break the earplugs of my old wireless bluetooth headphones. So in comparison obviously wireless headphones are much better. But considering if you need wired headphones, this is a good quality but I do feel stress in my ears if I put it on for hours as my job needs to be on phone all the time specially during work from home. Sound quality is between good to average. Not disappointing in terms of build quality.

The bass quality is really good. The buds really occludes the ear to give a passive noise cancellation. For me, the ear gets pain only after a usage  of 3-4 hours. It's good at this price point. Microphone quality is fair as no one has complained about it but our voice tends to have lower pitch for the person on other side of the call. Also I am a rough user and has been using it for 3 months, no built quality issues have arised.

Getting both style and quality at this price is the best thing about this product. The audio quality is fairly good for this price. Bass is normal, which is in a way a good thing. Very durable.

I got these amazing earphones at 350.and they performed above my expectations.Amazing build quality comparable premium wired earphones.Fits perfectly and I love the bass It is awesome.I like punchy BASS. Mids and highs are also very good. And honestly I love these earphones. Earlier I also used MI AND REALME BUDS. but boult x1 are very good. I suggest everyone in this price segment they are best.

The sound quality is better than other products you get at this price point. I have had products from Boat, Realme, Redmi and other brands. But these are better than almost every other brand in this price. The bass is not overtly punchy but it is good enough. Don't expect a Sennheiser or a Sony quality sound but it gets the work done. I will give it an 8.5/10 overall.

The sound quality is crazy.The cable build is strong.Fits perfectly.Outer Box is compact.Waterproof for a 350rs headset is insane.Its offers premium sound.I am a gamer and when I went live on YouTube with it, The output was brilliant.My friend bought Blue color. It costs 50rs extra. But it offers the same sound. On his suggestion,  I bought this headset, and well its one of the best in this segment. 1 year warranty when mi headphones offers only 6 months warranty.

I purchased this product after solely on the basis of its reviews on Amazon. Firstly, I was apprehensive about the product, but the moment I plugged it I found the audio quality perfect. The Bass, Treble and voice levels are equally balanced. The 10mm driver gives you sufficient Bass. Once you plug them you start feeling them. Very light weight and gets easily fits into your ears. Overall a great value for money under Rs. 500 mark.

I have been a Boult Audio earphones user since 2-3 years, rheir products are always satisfactory,providing best quality in mid range priceBoult Bassbuds X1 is a great choice in this price range ,Bass is awesome with perfect balance of tereble and at high volumes it works very perfect as i prefer high volumes,talking about after sales service i got a very satisfactory result i got the item replaced very easily no hectic works

if you are bass lover fan like me and you should compromise treble,than these earphones are good.it has very panic sound that u can't even listen one song clearly but Here a tip that if u want clear base and treble than i would suggest u to use bass booster app or system audio effects in your phone.after apply these apps sound quality is extreme levelalso i bought these earphones in sale of 350 rs but due to some problem my  order delivered late so in that case amazon issued rs 40 gift card in my accountso thank you amazon for your services😍😍😍

I strongly believed that great earphones cost a lot. In my order history, you will find V-Moda, Beats, Skullcandy. But this product rewrote whats value for money is. Initially, you will find it odd fitting the phone into your ears because of design, but it gets comfortable over time. For a product from a fashionable consumer electronics company, this is a job well done.

Product stopped working after a month. After many follow up, got the response to send back the product to there address via speedpost and the charges will be beared by the customer. So what's the use of 1 year warranty when these additional cost are not covered where it's not fault of customer. And they say it's there policy, when asked them to send us the policy they say we can't.  Then how we supposed to know what's there hidden policy to cheat customer.

Brought 2 and both are really good VFM. The sound quality is nothing above great but its really good considering the price I got both for 299 and one of which has been working great for more than 6 months now. The other was brought recently so I guess they're pretty durable too..

Sound quality is decent enough as per price as well the bass quality. Only problem i felt is related to comfort after wearing it for long. Though buds are with support for better adjustment and hold but after using it for just 30 mins i starts feeling bit of pain.I tried to use the different size as well and tried different size combinations bt still comfort wise these are not upto the mark.

Just an OKAY product, nothing extraordinary.

I ordered this product once and replaced it once too. Both of them were not connecting through the jack, most of the time.

I bought two of this product. Both of them have poor Mic voice quality. The voice is very low and very noisy. It is so bad that I have to order a new one for the use.Don't purchase this product if you are considering using the Mic at any point for a WhatsApp call or other calls.

If you want to purchase earphone for bass and high and clear sound, DONT BUY this product. Sound quality in the term of bass and clearity is not up to the mark at all.Boat is much more better than this earphone in terms of build quality, sound quality abd bass quality.And worst case is you can only replace this item and cannot return.Very upset with this product.Dear amazon, at least give return option, so one can return this product and purchase another one.

This is the best headphone you can get in actually within rupees 1k range. Superb Bass and Treble both.. I don't know they have made this balance... But believe me... When you will use them you will forget all other headphones.I have earlier used Boat 255 headphones. They were mainly focussing on Bass only. So clarity was hampered. But that is not case here. Also, same performance is achieved with Boult Loop In headphones which my wife is using.Build quality is also superb and feels premium.Without any thought just go for it!!!

Here i am writing this review after 5 months of uses,first of all speaking about the sound quality the sound quality is ok you can enjoy the sound,2nd base is also good not more not cheap it is balanced bass which you can enjoy while listening the music but after 5 months of uses the sound gets distorted and mic also got damaged, according to my opinion they should upgrade to the quality of the products overall it was good

The product came on time but it's not supported in my POCO F1, while earphones are connected the audio is coming through phone speaker, same problem during whatsapp video call.

While playing pubg audio is automatically reducing and increasing.

Worked wonderfully till it worked. Stopped working after 6 months. Although Amazon says 1year warrenty in Boult warrenty page it allows warrenty clame only for last 4months.I brought the product on Jun 2020, stopped working in Dec 2020. Tried to clam on Jan 2021. So I could not clame it.The product feels and sounds extramly good for the price. But does not last long.
"
5566,"
Overall the product is one of the best of all its competitors in this price range. The eartips and earhooks give a comfortable fit so that it doesn't fall off easily. The sound quality was pretty good along with a superb bass. The treble could be a more punchy but considering the price point it is pretty good. The metallic build give it a premium feel. Also there is no latency or sound delay while playing games. Overall a nice product.

Not good , i had bought this approx 4 months back and the left one stopped working properly within a week. The left one volume was decreased and its not audible. Then i was really disappointed from boult when i called the customer care one lady told me that i have to write a review and based on that i could get something. But it didn't happen. Lol 😆. Honestly its a riskier product to buy. Buy at your own risk. Plz dont read the review as ppl forget to update it as i had forgotten.

I think it does the job pretty well considering it's price. The thing I liked the most about it that it seems to be quite robust and kind of works even if used bit carelessly. In most ear plugs, once of the ear buds would stop working within a month or so of usage. This seems to be holding up pretty well till now.

The product in itself is pretty decent for this price range,has a comfortable fit and the fact that you can change the earhooks according to your comfort makes it better.I would've given a higher rating if not for very poor packaging,I've only got two words for it ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC.Apart from that everything else was fine with the product.Here's whats you get in the package---1.

It's a fantastic pair of earphones Bass is decent wouldn't say the best the best, Now treble is on point but Mid's are not so accurate but it can be fixed if you have Dolby enabled device like Realme Phones where tuning to Movie mode can really enhance the audio & Microphone quality is below decent so I won't Recommended to use in important calls but rest en all this is the best pair of earphones under 450 INR, No doubt about it!

They are really awesome under the range of 300-400 Rs. I would recommend it if you love music . I'm using them for Music and Gaming . Awesome build quality . Change - So i've been using them since last 6 months and now they've stopped working properly the speakers doesn't provide the full volume when the volume is full it will give only 25% sound which ia actually annoying but at this price range the earphones worked for 6 months which is actually good .

The earphones came within a day of ordering. The quality of the earphones is stupendous! Earphones are made of metal and sound very great. The wings are silicon and are not a issue for long term/length usage. The bass is good and treble is well balanced. The wires are Kevlar braided but doesn't seem sturdy enough at first glance. The headphone jack is tilted which gives it a new look.Over all a great pair of earphones for 300INR with a ONE YEAR WARRANTY.

Top notch audio quality but there seems to be some something wrong about noise cancellation doesn’t works that good. Fit and finish is Genuinely great.

The earphones are good if you are only listening to music or one app. If you play an app in the background for eg teams and mute the audio from there, the quality of the music deteriorates. It sounds very bad. The mic is also very bad. On most of my calls people say they can't hear me. I didn't expect this from a brand like Boult.

Overall the performance of this earphone is amazing . At the purchase time I think it's just an ordinary earphone just like other & price is higher but believe me I am wrong .I never expecte more but i shocked when I use it first time .Noise cancellation is amazing whis is unbelievable and sound quality is also good anough.i used this earphones for gaming as well.i never expected this kinda performance at this budget.i think it's the best earphones under 399.

If you are playing a song or on a call, if you plugin the earphones in between, they won't connect. You'll have to stop son, connect earphones and start song.

I have received the product but the earphones are defective. Replaced 2 times in year but received the defective product. The quality and service was very poor.Case Ref. No.0030682826th Feb 2022-  2 days back I received a call from Mr. XYZ person from boult and requested to delete the review and offer me to replace my earphone.

I purchased soo many earphones from different companies but this one is above all in this price segmentThe sound quality is par excellence.The bass is great.You can do many activities while wearing this earphone and it will not loose grip from your ears.Only thing which i did not like is noise cancellation effectiveness. It did cancel noise but not to a great extent.All i can say is this boult earphone is just awesome in this price segment.

It been a year i buyer ittoday is 7 nov almost 6 monthPoint to keep in mind1. Bass not upto the mark2. Very heavy3. The mechanism of wearing is painful after a time4. Build quality is nice5. No instrument separation all feels like using a 100 ruppee earphone6. Go for JBL or MI
"
5638,"
Best buy for 200. Bass is pretty loud. Just what i wanted. If bass is what you want don't think twice. Buy this. but keep in mind the wires coating is rubber so will not long last if heavy usage is done. Doesn't have volumes up down button. Just call pick up end button.Will update if it stops working after sometime as other reviews said

It is amazing and surprisingly doesn't tangle much...sound is nice, mic is awesome, calling is also good, sound in one ear at a few time was distorted but then it never happend so i think it doesn't matter anyway. I love it and the service is also very good. Afyer i registered for warranty they called a few times to know if i was satisfied and they are helping so i would definitely but different and more products from boult in future👍🏼😁

For the price point of below 300, it's a damn good earphone with decent sound as well as base. I have one wireless earphone of 1.5k but can't use it for gaming due to sound latency, using this for 6 to 7 hours a day for classes and games... a bit uncomfortable on ears but can't complain much
"

Good quality from this brand. Was  My first purchase of the brand. Audio quality is good . I haven't tested mic will post its result later. Only problem I face is plastic folding noise when trying the earphones in ear
"
5642,"
Overall it is an excellent value for price. Sound quality is good. It is comfortable and light in weight - so it can be kept on for 3-4 Hours without discomfort. Bass quality could have been better, but I suppose for the price it is ok. If you listen to Rock music of the 70's era, which have a lot of Guitar Riffs and Bass Drum, and if you are a big bass addict,  this may not be right - no complaints otherwise.

Posting the review after 3 months of heavy usage.Bass quality: 5/5Sound quality: 4.5/5Noise cancellation: 4/5Comfortness: 4.5/5Over all 4.5/5At this price point (Rs. 349) this earphones are the best. Just go for it.Update* (17/08/21) - right earphone stopped working. :/Now I am applying for exchange it. Will update soon.

This is the best earphones in this price range. I'm using these for past 12 months. And reordered as one side of the previous one stopped working.This time this product received in wet condition. There's raining outside. But delivery boy didn't use any protection. The upper covering given by Amazon is not able to keep the product safe.But the product is not damaged, so no issues.
"

Great product! Bass centric sound spectrum, with good quality mids and lows. Comfortable to wear, and a good mic. Even the jack and wire are pretty good, not too fragile at all.IMO even better than CX180, which is pretty disappointing.

Not happy with this purchase, worked for a few day. Now my music randomly pauses, and no one can hear me when i use them to make a phone call.Pretty much a waste of my money, regardless of the price.

These earphones actually come with subwoofers as mentioned in description' Great Bass quality great buy. Got them at 349rs in limited time deal  I've been using this from past 6 months. This was the actual earphones that i was searching for.. And really had a great experience.Specs of the earphones are great, the micro woofers deliver you great sound quality and bass. And the noise cancellation is upto the mark. Earphones never slips from the ears and you too won't allow them to as they deliver gread sound effect.
"
5648,"
I purchased this product recently and sound Quality of this product is very good even better than boat earphones and noise cancellation is also very good and bass quality is excellent. I provide a better music quality and any other earphones brand in this price. I also have boult audio curve neckband which i purchase 3 months ago and i am fully satisfied and appreciate that product. After that i purchase this boult audio x1 and this product is also very good.
"
5649,"
For the price may be good but I can say that sound quality is utter trash no mids at all, that overpowering bass just muds the whole mids, vocals are clear and highs are also okayish , no instrument seperation at all, these are just super bass heavy earphones for bass nerds and me being a music producer don't suite me as i prefer a flatter sound profile. Build quality is great that ear hook will cause some pain and discomfort at first but you'll get used to it. I would suggest mi basic over these as those have Better sound profile and far better mids.
"

The earphones are covered in dust even on the inside. The black paper packing holding the earphones seems like it was just glued together by cheap glue.There is a warranty card inside but the entire packing seems like it a fake and not an original product.The earphones though work great. Good quality sound, bass and built.Disappointed in the packing, unsure if it's an original product or a fake one.
"
5651,"
i found li't bit uncomfortable and middle size buds are ok,but one of them is very lose so it goes out on its own,and remaining buds are not comfortable .Bigger size  is feels like very big and the smaller one are feels like very small.I'll suggest you to buy mivi brand instead of this ( 20/01/22)
"
5652,"
This is really a good product, sound quality is also very good.And I personaly like the way it equalise the sound during music and movies.And I don't thing that any other brand or company provide such a sound in this price.And I would like to say that If you are looking for a best wired earphone than you should go for it.

This earphone is not so good in built quality as compared to other if you are looking a product in this range only then you can go for it otherwise add 100 rs in your budget and you can get 2x better earphone than this. I am using it for my online studies but it is some problematic as the sound is not clear very much and also while listening the songs the bass is not so good .I am giving 3 stars only for its design and mic quality
"

Sound quality is not upto mark. Base is high but instrument separation is worst, you miss alot of music specially the mid tone. Mic was not working so I want to return but only replace option is available.. so have to use it. Think before buying it.

Even cheaper earphones have better sound capturing quality than these earphones. I have had very bad calling experiences with these earphones. I tried returning these but there was no option to return them, what should I do when don't just want to replace these. I've wasted my money.
"

Poor quality product. Mic quality is very poor. Every time the other person on the call complaints of low voice. I thought problem is with my unit only but after replacement also the product quality is still the same. Audio quality on songs is also average. In same price range boat is better brand.
"

If you are looking a budget earphone with high quality sound and heavy bass just go for it, similar brand like boat, only 1 issue 1. Earplugs are little bit big and heavy....But overall this earphone is a good choice if you are bass lover.

Unbeatable voice and earbuds are superb you just fit in ur ear and carry on full day.Thank you so much to give this product.One more feature that i liked it has google assistant command button.And it comes with one year warranty which i think any other brand can't give it.

It's really awesome. I didn't this this much of better music experience in premium earphones also. Bass, sound quality and built quality is really awesome. And the price is too low.

From a 15 days user-Best in price segment. good sound, bass and vocals are clear. Also they provided extra earpieces in the box (2 pair) and i aso used realme buds classic which claims 14.2 mm driver that only a number game its powerful 10mm driver also provide good bass only one thing that the sound is not to much loud but then everyone have their own choice but overall it is good one.(also 1year warranty is a plus point) Just simply go for it.

The sound quality is good and even the bass and the snug fit of the earphones is good, I used it almost round the clock and maybe it's not that durable even with the Work from home situation, It's June and I bought it in Mar'21, right earphone isn't working anymore.I've since bought a Bluetooth earphone instead of a different brand

Amazing.  Sound, price, noise canceling, fit.Have used jbl, sennheiser, skullcandy, costing around 1k-1.5k.

A good pair of earphones. Not very balanced sound but bass and trebel is good, so it makes many songs good to hear. If you like base heavy earphones, this will fulfil your needs. I have made some adjustments in equalizer to make it sound better according to my need. I have installed ""headphones equalizer"" app to reduse the sharp ""hiss"" sounds that this earphones make. Overall a good value for money.

Its good for listening experience the ear speakers sounds premium , but the mic is very poorly constructed.

Budget conscious headphone featuring light weight, super comfortable, great look with dynamic sound quality. Headphone cable hook over the top of the ear and swivelling bud keep them secure at place all the time.

Highly impressed with the product and cannot think of any pair of headphone at this price that come close

I had bought these earphones in May, 2021 and now giving my experience.These earphones have been best in this price range.Even we get 2 to 3 pairs of earplugs, the thing I liked and the earphone I could have used till now.In whole I totally recomment this one.

The built quality is really nice, really nice packaging and multiple options of ear tips also, the only thing I didn't like about this product is that the quality of sound output is not up to the mark, it could have been a better but overall really good product and just a thing is that the ear tips are a bit stiffer and it hurts the ears after some time.  No distortion at maximum volume.overall good product.

Honestly not worth of even one star. Everytime you need to adjust mic while you speak else the other end person will not be able to hear you. Its quite bizarre to have two headphones one for call and one for songs. Mic has huge problem with adjustable settings. It does not change itself you have to do it manually. Not worth it.

I bought boult bass buds X1 couple of days back. The headphone is awesome and loved this when compared to other similar headphones at this budget. This is my first purchase of a boult headphone and I did not expect a product like boult at an affordable price. To be frank I am a regular JBL headphone lover for the past 8 years. Just tried buying boult and the performance is extraordinary.Pros: Built quality, design, light weight, great bass sound effect and easy fit.

Not a great purchase. Can be better compared to price. Have uses JBL, Boat, Sony and Scullcand. Best is Sony and this takes least rating. Sound quality was better even on low cost models of boat n skull candy. Even noice cancellation was not as expected. Can be bought at 200 or so..

The earphone is superb, nice noise cancellation with the use of the given sizes of ear buds, you have to use according to your size. Bass is good as well as the mids and the trebles which is equally important.  I use this extensively approx 14 hours a day, comfortable enough as well

The sound quality is good, it has good bass but lacks thump. Being a proud owner os sony xb950, i found this to be irritating at higher volume. Even though they are worlds apart, you tend to compare. But at this price, it is sort of given, and it has good value for money. It is better to buy senheiser or jbl which cost double than this, but they are more pleasant to use. At this price, this is good, could have been better.

I am absolutely happy with the product by Boult . The main advantage of this product is that it can fit into your ear perfectly because of its beautiful design. The sound quality is much better than any other earphone along with a 10 mm driver. Noise cancellation is incredibly good at this price range and the bass quality too meeting up with the expectations. Overall I can suggest it to any person who wants a good experience very cheaply without any compromise in the quality.

These are one of the best earphones you'll find at this price(Rs 328 is how much i paid) . The build quality is good and the vocals are decent too. They get pretty loud. I've been using sennheiser cx 180 and compared to them these obviously aren't the same but using these don't feel like a downgrade. Buy these if they're available below 400 rs. Don't pay more than that. Overall I'm really impressed.

After using it for a week i am going to write this review- If you are going to purchase an wired earphones than this is best one in the range of 500-700, As the sound quality is smooth and clear to ear.-It has titanium coating pin and slightly tilted which decreases the  direct pressure on it and will  increases its life.-Wires are strong and durable as compared to other brands.I would like to suggest one update -To make the earpods magnetic.

Also has first experience from the company(Boult) as in getting a call with regards to performance of the product and whether am I facing any issues with the same. Good branding and Royalty programme.

Gives you good sound quality and noise cancellation. Fits well in your ears. Try not to use it for longer duration.

It has an elegant design, with highly effective ear-fins that make a perfect seal for passive noise cancellation. But the best part is the Kevlar Cable that does not tangle! this is an underrated feature but probably the best. However, the bass could have been better. But at this price point asking a lot seems illogical. Calling them the most cost-effective wired earphone in India would not be a reach.Highly Satisfied!

You won't regret it !! I'm a DJ and Music Producer, I can assure you from my experience that it's the best one at this price range. Sound mastering is so accurate, every frequency is in the perfect range, vocals are totally clear, perfect bass levels and mid frequencies. Also loudness...!

Truly a wonderful purchase for the price (I got it for 349), light on the ear so it's comfortable to wear for long hours of listening, sound quality is perfect for the price, not much bass but clear clarity and you'll get used to the sound in no time. Built quality is good too, using it since October 2020, no visible wear and tear although I've been using it rough since I bought it. Great purchase.

Best in its range .

Mainly buyed it because of mic which was not present in my earlier sennheiser cx street earphone .Overall a great product to go with .

Well it's better than any of its competitors within this price range.Build quality- It's good and durable for day to day usage ,would have been better is earpieces were a bit aesthetic and curved.Bass- Bass is average can't expect more with this price.Not for bass lovers thoughAudio- Audio is crisp but a bit distortion is noticeable even at lower volumes.

Editing my review after 2 months of use. Headphone's right side has lower sound as compared to left side. I gave it to others also they too said same thing with their phone. Also right side occasionally turns off  . Customer support is also very bad. When I asked of replacement they said I will have to courier this to New Delhi and team would test or repair this headphone. Complete wastage of time and money. Deserves 1 star

I'm writing this after using it for a month. Honestly, A great product for the price. The sound is very clear. The buds are very comfortable. The headset is lightweight so it's very soft when placed inside ears.The one thing which is missing is bass. The bass is low. But what we pay is what we get. For this price the bass is worth. I will definitely suggest this product if they are looking for budget earphones.

For some reason the other color options of this earphones does not deliver that much bass as compared to the grey one. I tried the blue and red variant as well but they had low bass as compared to the grey color one. BUY GREY ONLY.  The grey one is amazing. Sound is amazing, the bass is amazing.

The sound quality of these earphones are perfect and are compatible to that of costly ones. But there's still a catch to it, if you want to lay down on the bed facing one side and use your phone it wold not be comfortable,rather it would pain in your ears, rest it's very nice to buy these. It would not come out of your ears in every condition (best suited for exercise).

This was my first time using boult and I am quite satisfied with the product. It has good sound quality. The most important thing for me was the microphone, it works quite well.

Ordered these as my wired extras. Perhaps a little bassy, but a lot more than what you'd expect at this price. Good build quality. But not the ones if you're looking for that premium sound quality. A 5 star rating because it cost me only Rs.349 and it seems worth a lot more.

This is a good earphone to buy within 350 rupees. Its look can't tell about its price. Once putting the earbuds in your ear you won't be able to hear any other sound around you rather than song or video you will be playing in your device. Overall looks good, better noise cancellation, fits in ears and affordable price make it value for money product. You must buy this if your budget is 350 rs.

Don't trust boult any more because this earphones are having 1yrs warranty but when I got it and I tried to register for warranty from warranty card it is showing that they are updating their warranty page daily I am trying same I had also tried to contact boult on email but trust me no respond will be dropped from boult after purchasing it.

Have been using it for a few weeks now and I am totally satisfied with Boult. The only thing is that the earpieces are a bit heavier as compared to other earphones that I've used in the past like Boat Bassheads. If you are not acquainted with heavy earpieces, you will feel a slight pain in your ears for the first few days only. after regular use for a few days, it gets totally comfortable even with long hours of usage.

Great product.if you are buying thease then keep in mind that using this may make your ear sore but it's temporary and you will get used to it and the pain will go away in 2 to 3 days.It's sound quality is amazing and it really cancells 70 percent of the background noise so if you ask me it's totaly worth it

I have been using the product for two months now and have had the best experience. The product is amazing given the it's price. It's easily one of the cheapest and arguably the best at it's range.

I purchased 2 earphones, one was fine and sound-built is really great. But, another one was defective, the 3.5mm Jack was not defective also mic was not working, created a replacement and the replacement earphone I got had a defective microphone.So my overall experience wasn't good with Boult.

You can imagine the quality of it. Very hard and excellent material it made of. I washed them two times in my pocket still they are working fine. Amazing product in this price tag.

Writing the review after Using it for more than a month. It's a very good product in this price range. I've used the boat earphones from the same price range  before buying this product. One thing to mention that , this product has quite good noice cancellation. Bass is also just perfect. If you want good earphones in this price range , You should really go for it. Even I also got to know that Boult is an Indian Brand.#Vocal_for_local.

Sound Quality is The Best, But Noise Cancellation with Mic INCALL was poor. All of those whom I Called have said to me that there's lots of noise when I used earphones & it's better without earphones. The mic captures lots of noise from the background. I don't know if it's just with my unit but I ordered a replacement But still the same.

The battery gets discharged quickly even when switched off. I had sent it to the service centre but they returned the product as it is without performing any repairs.Poor Service.
"

When plugged in for the first time to music... it's working fine but it's impossible to take any calls. The other person either hears a lot of noises with a very low voice or nothing at all. Even for music the sound quality is poor. The music will rage in your ear to the extent your head hurts. There is no subtlety or mellowness to the music.
"
5837,"
For the price good clarity sound with a decent bass and passive noise cancelling also good enough but the warranty card with QR is not working but I register in their page for warranty but I don't know how to confirm its warranty registration for 349 its good to go and fine on I will update the review after 1 month of use

Like :- Great sound quality, Great in noice cancellation, Good bass, Great price point.Dislikes :- Not so good wire quality,Not a fan of the 3.5mm jacks shape it really does screws sometimes , no multifunction button mic quality not so good.

This was my first Boult product and I am happy to get value for money. I liked the shape of headphone jack the most.If you like high bass then you need to set equaliser for that rest sound quality is good for movies and music.As there is no active noise cancellation (neither you get that in this price segment) other party can listen to your surroundings but you won't face any difficulty listening to him because of the in-ear style.
"

Worth every penny . The sound quality ofthe earphones is awesome. The way bass works is excellent and you will not hear the background music in this earphone.Having 2 pair of extra ear ring it allows you to have a perfect fit. The game play will enchance totally as it sound is too clear and having a very good noise cancellation.Op level sound it is ,Thanks to Boult earphones having a excellent engineering.

I had used Sennheiser cx180, Apple earbuds, Boat 255F bluetooth earphone. Today I have received Boult bassbud x1 from Amazon. When I 1st used it to listen to some music, trust me the sound quality, bass, noise cancellation everything was just perfect for a earphone with price ₹379. Build quality is good also. Red one is nice to eye. But it depends on your preference.Don't think twice, just go for it.

The jack of the earphone is slightly thinner than standard one, hence it is loose and not fit in any mobile tightly. If it be tightened, the connection get lost. So this product becomes not right for me. Sound is satisfactory.

Everythng is fine, but the thing is , Speaker which fits in the ear is heavy, you cannot hold them for more than 10 min as of me.

Sound clarity in lows , mid and highs is better than other options in this price range.Bass is not that much as compared to ""boat basshead 225"" but vocals and sound quality is obviously better.

Sound quality, noise cancellation, bass quality is average, because I expected much more after looking at reviews.

These are undoubtedly the best budget earphones in sub ₹350/- category. The quality of sound, noise cancellation is good and bass is excellent. The only downside is the thickness of wire. The wires connecting the two ear buds is thinner other than that everything is good. I would rate it 7/10.

These earphones are value for money. I personally bought this one because it has the angular connector and the earfins. As far as sound quality goes it's pretty good.

I got it for just 299 only and these are the best in this price i think and size of the earphones are very thin so use it carefully it will may be cutted or lossened from the audio button if u stretch it or allowed to sharp objects and main thing is boult giving a 1 year warranty so this will be best thing they had done for this earphones on this range .

An average pair. Although it is fair for its price and is better than its competitors, it is a little too base heavy for me and the audio is quite muffled due to excess of low frequencies.

Very durable and light weighted. I use it for long hours and it doesnt even hurt. Keep up the good work Boult Team!

If used for music, these earphones will perform good with good bass. But prolong usage of this earphone will cause pain in your ears. As they fit very tightly in your ears you'll hear your voice echoing in your head while talking on phone so for calling purpose it is not also a good choice.So if you're looking for comfort don't buy these, but for bass lovers it could be nice choices.Thank you

Earlier I was using Bluetooth headphones of JBL, so it's bass quality is way better than that of JBL. Significant difference in the sound quality also. So yes I like these headphones. But my only disappointment with them is that I can't enjoy 3d it 8d music which was one of the reason I ordered them.

Looks at the price of this earphones, I feel its worth it. For long hours it can become slightly difficult.But the sound, bass and noise cancellation is great.Good wire quality and the mic is really good. So really happy with the overall with the amount of money spent.

This headphone is absolutely waste of money. Please don't buy, your ears will hurt...l mean hurt a lot. Poor sound quality, poor material quality. Go for Boat or MI headphones over it. I am requesting please don't buy this product, you are gonna regret.

Pros: Good for talking.Cons:one side stopped working within a month you need to increase volume for bass at low volume bass is negligible. And lot of noise when having conversions.

I have bought this product 2 months ago and i found its really good. This was my first time to buy this brand and i think i will buy it again. Its bass quality and noise cancellation is really good. If you are student just like me you know it well we just can't afford very expensive products each time. Its cheap and best. Its worth it.

Pros1) Excellent Build Quality2) Good microphone3) Sound Quality is very good at this price point.4) Good for calls too, kudos to the mic.Cons1) The earbuds design sometimes makes listening to music lil uncomfortable for extended periods.But it's a MUST BUY at this price point.

Earphones are pretty good . The sound quality is good pretty clear noise cancellation works very well Bass is just the amount you need (not too high not too low ) . But compared to my boat bass 225 the wire thickness is decent (not so good) . But at 329 overall its a good deal .
"
5955,"
Pros: Sound quality is good. Noise wont come in. Bass is there to some extent.Cons: heavy on ears. Ear gets pain if worn for above 1 hr.Price is less. For short time uses its a definite buy. But for long hours, go for boat wireless ones, light and comfortable on ears.

Firtsly I was worried that I'm going to invest in some new brand, then I check-out the net and found it is the co brand of Boat Audio. Then I purchased 2 of this earphone for myself and sister. Ones mic was perfect but another was not that much good so I replaced it and got new one with amazingly good looking pouch :)Totally happy with sound and bass quality.

Product Quality was very cheap in one months time one side stop working. Not to worthy buy this product, when we approached Amazon team they said it sellers warranty, Amazon will not able to help on this, if that is the case than why AMAZON is selling the pack...

I've been using these earphones for almost 3 months now and they're really good. They fit in the ear properly and it doesn't cause any pain in the ear when used for longer durations. The sound quality is amazing and really good at this price. Also, the build quality looks good too.
"

Audio is clear, better than Mi basic because I am using them. These can go pretty Loud. Bass is not much. Good for videos. Mi basic are more comfortable in ear but these Boult X1 also have good comfort. Forget about claiming warranty, they don't have service centers. Believe your luck and buy.

Product is ok but they force you to review it on handle. They offer you rewards for that. But the fact is they won't respond after writing the product review. Product is a decent one but irritating for a review and that too by manipulating is not a good thing.

Pros:1. Better earphone at this price point.2. Light weight & easy to use3. Ear loop helps to hold the buds to ear4. MIC quality id good.5. Sound quality is good.Cons:1. Cause Ear pain on long usage.2. No volume/Forward control

Sound is awesome bass is awesome but there is only one problem for me is if you put it in ear more tym it goes painful .... otherwise overall product is as good as expected... bought it for 299rs. and for this price great deal

Literally they are the best I have tried at this price. Sound quality is just awesome. Noise cancellation works truly fine. Another important aspect is of comfort. So you get snug fit design rubber support which doesn't allow earphones to come out easily and doesn't hurt your ear. So if you have a budget around 300-400, just go for them... You will be more than happy.Thanks #BoultAudio

This item is nonsense.  And gives the company a false warranty.  And if you call, they don't answer exactly. It's been four months since I took the earphones.  And the earphones are broken. Company don't respond properly. This is a chip product.

I ordered this product 3 times, 1st time product quantity was amazing, but after that company has made some quality comprises changes in product (specifically in MIC ), ,now modified design is not so satisfying.

I have been using boult for more than a month now, I have loved the voice quality and bass of the product but I am not happy with the design make of the product. Personally I have removed the support buds given also i am not comfortable wearing it for long time as my ear starts hurting.Overall superb voice quality but needs work on its design
"

Tbh..the ear buds are discomfortable ....there is no problem with sound , bass etc...But the main thing is that when you are paying almost 400₹ for a wired earphone u can expect that there will be no issues regarding anything ...ear buds can give discomfort so that's why I didn't it an excellent product acc.yo priceDelivery was supper fast ( just got it next day)
"

Over all the sound quality is good.But the only problem is with the mic.I am unable to receive and end the calls with the button.The voice to the receivers is also not clear. Boult please do ch eck before launching as if we are unable to use the microphone it is of no use while riding.

Wire quality is good, but 3.5 mm jack doesn't fit properly on mobile. slight touch to jack , it comes off. not suitable for travelling , Tried on Vivo V11 pro , Redmi Note - same issue
"

The sound quality for this price point is the best. And I feel u should not compare this with boat 225, coz they are 100-200 more than this, and as price rise the quality also changes.So overall this boult audio basebuds x1 is best in this price.
"

Balanced Sound, it wouldn't blow your mind. Bass is not great. Sound feels balanced even after Equalizer Customization.If your budget is 299 then go for it but, if Sound Quality needed then checkout Clavier Neo wired earphones.
